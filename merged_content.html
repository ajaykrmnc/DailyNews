It creates stable habitats for birds, pollinators, and soil organisms, while also lowering local temperatures by about one degree Celsius. In India, agroforestry could remove around 68 mega tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere every year.
</p><p>Currently, India has approximately 13.75 million hectares under agroforestry, but this represents only a small fraction of its potential. Agroforestry can diversify farmer income through fruit trees, timber species, and medicinal plants, while also improving soil health, water retention, and climate resilience. However, several challenges persist.
</p><p>Regulatory restrictions on tree harvesting and trade pose significant challenges to agroforestry implementation. As of 2023, only 33 tree species are legally permitted for free harvesting and transportation between States, limiting farmers’ ability to select species freely. High-value species such as teak and sandalwood require government permits, creating bureaucratic barriers that discourage farmers from cultivating them.
</p><p>Another major issue is the lack of information. Many farmers do not know which species combinations are best suited to their land or how to participate in carbon markets. Though digital tools and government incentives exist, they are often out of reach for farmers due to language, literacy, or connectivity barriers.
</p><p>To bridge these gaps, I have begun developing AgroConnect, a prototype digital platform designed to turn policy insights into practical support for farmers. AgroConnect aims to be a one-stop ecosystem where small and marginal farmers can make informed decisions about agroforestry and access economic incentives.
</p><p>Our research also examined Cameroon, where agroforestry is widely practised, though mostly informally. Local farmers have long used diverse agroforestry practices to sustain their livelihoods and protect biodiversity. However, the lack of technical support and market access has limited the impact of these practices.
</p><p>These insights from Cameroon reveal a shared challenge: in both countries, agroforestry’s potential is not constrained by land or people, but by the systems meant to support them.
</p><p>This project was part of the Entente Cordiale Day Challenge 2025, a prestigious Franco-British competition held under the high patronage of President Emmanuel Macron and King Charles III. Rooted in the 120-year-old Entente Cordiale alliance, this initiative fosters collaboration between leaders of France and the U.K.
</p><p>Representing France, I collaborated with peers from Cameroon and France to develop this interdisciplinary proposal on the theme “Climate change, biodiversity, and developing countries”.
</p><p>We came first in France and were awarded the Prix Président Loubet (President Loubet Award), the highest honour. We presented our work at the London School of Economics, and engaged in discussions at the U.K. House of Commons and the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office. We had the honour of presenting our solution to Salaheddine Mezouar, the former Minister of Foreign Affairs of Morocco and President of COP22.
</p><p>Our team has also been invited to present at the Élysée Palace (the official residence of the President of France) and at the U.K. House of Lords, and I am proud to share that our research paper has been officially published by the Entente Cordiale Association, further recognising its impact and feasibility.
</p><p>India’s farmers stand at the forefront of both climate vulnerability and ecological opportunity. Agroforestry offers them a way to contribute to climate resilience while improving their long-term financial stability. However, to scale adoption, it must be supported by the right mix of policy, technology, and trust.
</p><p>By investing in inclusive and scalable models, we can ensure that India’s path to a greener future is not only achievable, but is already underway.

                                      </p></div><div id="content-body-69661755" itemprop="articleBody"><p><span class="drop-caps">I</span> still remember the dread that washed over me every time the maths teacher began calling students to the blackboard. A moment I was sure would appear in my memoirs, titled “The Anxiety Chronicles”. My palms would go cold, my legs stiff. I would sit silently, eyes glued to the notebook, praying she would not call me. But somehow, it was always my name. And the moment she called it out, I would rise with trembling hands, walk to the front of the class, and face the board like a wall too tall for me to climb ever.</p><p>I wasn’t bad at school. But I wasn’t good at the right things.
</p><p>Maths and science never came naturally to me. I could not solve an equation in 30 seconds like the girl sitting next to me. I did not enjoy balancing chemical reactions or memorising formulae. My interest leaned elsewhere — towards the co-curricular, towards subjects that let me feel, create, and express. Yet every day in school felt like a quiet reminder that the things I was drawn to were not the things that mattered. What did matter was speed with numbers, precision with logic, and high scores in what were always referred to as the “core subjects”.
</p><p>Those who could do that — my classmates who raced through equations or recited the periodic table effortlessly — were celebrated as intelligent, bright, promising. Teachers remembered their names. Parents compared us with them. And I, unable to see myself in that mould, quietly questioned my worth. I used to sit at my desk wondering what was wrong with me. Why couldn’t I understand a maths problem like my friend? Why did I freeze in front of the board while others shone? I was the daughter of a mother who teaches maths — surely, I was supposed to be better at this? Genetics, it turns out, has a sense of humour. That pressure sat quietly on my shoulders, unspoken but deeply felt. It was never about disappointing her — it was about disappointing the idea of what a “smart student” is supposed to look like.
</p><p>As I grew older, I realised that school wasn’t just teaching us subjects — it was shaping our ideas of intelligence, success, and self-worth. And somewhere along the way, it had told us a lie: that some talents are more valuable than others. Art, music, and drama are often treated as “extra” or “optional”, rarely defining excellence or carrying the same importance as a report card. And yet, what if your strengths lie there? What if you are the student who writes poetry that makes people pause, or choreographs with instinct and emotion, or leads teams with empathy and creativity? The reality is school rarely makes space for such minds. The damage isn’t just structural — it’s deeply personal. When schools prioritise certain abilities over others, they do not just shape education; they shape identity. I’ve seen so many students, including myself, doubt our worth because our brilliance did not fit the mould. We were made to feel like we were almost enough, but not quite. But intelligence is not a one-size-fits-all concept.
</p><p>Howard Gardner’s theory of multiple intelligences argues that there are many ways to be smart — linguistic, spatial, musical, interpersonal, bodily-kinesthetic, and more. The irony is the world we grow into doesn’t operate this way. Real-life success depends as much on creativity, collaboration, adaptability, and emotional insight as it does on logic and analysis. Yet schools continue to prepare students for a world that doesn’t exist outside their walls.
</p><p>If I could speak to my younger self now — the one who stood shaking at the blackboard — I would tell her this: your struggle in maths didn’t make you less. Your fear didn’t mean you lacked intelligence. Your interests weren’t side stories to someone else’s success — they were your story. And they matter.
</p><p>Today, I still believe in education. But I hope that the idea of a “brilliant student” evolves. That someday, schools will not just reward what fits the answer key, but also what makes us feel, move, think, and see the world differently. Because in the end, brilliance is not a formula. If it were, I would have definitely forgotten it by now. It’s the courage to be fully, unapologetically yourself — even when the system can’t quite measure it.

Letters were carefully written, folded, sealed in envelopes, and often carried the scent of a familiar perfume or pressed flower. The humble postage stamp, though small, acted as a passport for these messages, marking their journeys. Today, as digital communication prevails, postage stamps remind us of a slower, more meaningful time when sending a letter felt almost ceremonial.  </p><p>Stamps are more than proof of payment; they are miniature artworks and national symbols. Each design tells a story, showcasing leaders, cultural heritage, or historical events. For collectors, stamps are treasures, while for senders, they serve as tokens of connection. In India, stamps often feature Mahatma Gandhi, rare birds, or vibrant festivals, offering a glimpse into the country’s essence. Holding a stamp is like possessing a piece of history. 
</p><p>Children from earlier generations may remember waiting in line at post offices, choosing stamps, and carefully affixing them to envelopes. Sending a letter took planning and patience. When the letter arrived, recipients often admired the stamp as much as the message, with some even preserving envelopes for their decorative stamps. 
</p><p>There was also something deeply democratic about stamps. Whether the sender was a schoolchild writing to a pen pal, a soldier sending a note home, or a lover pouring emotions onto paper, the stamp made every message equal in its journey. It bore witness to joy, grief, love, and longing—silently sticking to its duty without fail. The wear and tear it endured mirrored the emotions it accompanied, its edges often frayed by distance and time. 
</p><p>With the rise of digital communication, the use of stamps has sharply declined. Letters have given way to texts, emojis, and voice messages. While the world is now faster and more connected, it feels more fleeting. Messages disappear with a swipe, and memories are stored in the cloud rather than in physical spaces. The joy of receiving handwritten letters and collecting stamps is slowly fading from our collective memory. 
</p><p>Yet, stamps continue to exist, if only in corners of nostalgia. Philatelists still gather, curating stories in albums. Some use stamps in creative projects — turning them into bookmarks, wall art, or keepsakes. For others, stamps remain reminders of a time when communication had depth, when people waited days, even weeks, for words that mattered. And for many, old letters with stamps tucked away in boxes are portals to the past, preserving relationships, moments, and emotions in their purest form. </p><p>In a world obsessed with speed, perhaps stamps urge us to slow down in order to remember that not everything needs to be instant. Some words deserve to travel slowly, to gather meaning with each mile, and to arrive with a stamp of memory. As relics of personal history and cultural heritage, stamps will always hold a place in our hearts — even if not on our envelopes. </p><p>sajnahmd@gmail.com</p><div id="arthardpv"></div><div></div><div><div id="artproduct2"></div></div><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/Hindu_Desktop_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/Hindu_Desktop_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid05, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid05, publisher: The Hindu --></div><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Mweb_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Mweb_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle05, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle05, publisher: The Hindu --></div></div></div><div><div><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_RT, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_RT, publisher: The Hindu --></div></div><div><div id="articledivtrendD"></div></div><div><div id="articledivtrendM"></div></div></div></div></div><div class="container article-section"><div><div data-id="69661788" data-title="Spying on little birds" data-url="https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/open-page/spying-on-little-birds/article69661788.ece"><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --></div><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --></div><h1 class="title" itemprop="name">

                                      </p></div><div id="content-body-69661788" itemprop="articleBody"><p><span class="drop-caps">I </span>made a silent dash to the window as I heard the loud chirping — or rather, chattering — of birds. At last, they were here! A tailorbird and her mate had perched beside their nest on the yellow hibiscus bush, making quite a racket. These were tiny birds, with greenish-yellow wings, pale yellow chests, and beaks that looked too long for their bodies. Their voices, surprisingly loud, did not match their sizes.</p><p>Nearby, another pair — shiny black with bluish hues and long, sharply curved beaks, likely a kind of sunbird — seemed to be quarrelling with the tailorbirds. They too were trying to build a nest in a branch of the yellow trumpet tree. The tailorbirds appeared unhappy with the intrusion, protesting the newcomers’ plan to build so close. After a bit more squabbling, the black pair flew away, leaving the tailorbirds to enjoy some peace. Perhaps they already had eggs in their nest.
</p><p>It was during one of my early morning garden strolls that I first spotted the nest. Neat and compact, it was stitched together from hibiscus leaves, bits of cotton, and soft scraps. At first, I was alarmed — thinking my bush had become infested with pests — until I realised it was a bird’s nest. How had I missed the construction?
</p><p>From then on, I watched eagerly for any sign of activity. But this was the first time I had actually seen the birds. Standing quietly on the cot, I realised I could observe them from the window without disturbing them. Days passed, and soon little beaks began poking out from the nest’s opening. The fledglings made hoarse cries — almost like a snake’s hiss. I watched in delight as the mother and father bird took turns feeding their hungry young. One day, I heard alarmed chirps and rushed out to investigate. A ginger cat was slinking along the compound wall near the hibiscus bush. Though it couldn’t reach the nest, I chased it away — for the birds’ peace of mind as much as for their safety.
</p><p>Before I knew it, the young birds were perching on the hibiscus branches and learning to fly. It had only been a couple of weeks since they hatched. I marvelled at how quickly these tiny creations of God grew up. Eventually, the nest was empty. The fledglings and their parents had flown away, leaving me feeling a bit disappointed. I still ran to the window at the sound of chirping, only to find the bush deserted.
</p><p>Time passed, and the memory of the birds began to fade — until one day I heard excited chirps again by the window. I quickly climbed onto the cot and peeked through the curtain. There they were — the same sunbirds who had earlier fought for nesting space. This time, they had begun building their own nest using bits of bark and spiderwebs. They would disappear for a while and return with tiny pieces of material. Day by day, the nest began to take shape. It was larger than the tailorbirds’ nest, but messier — more like a hanging sack, with a front-facing opening. Days turned to weeks, and yet the construction continued. The birds didn’t seem to be in any hurry.
</p><p>I was eager to witness the next chapter — eggs, hatching, and feeding. Seeing the size of the nest and the thin branch it hung from, I prayed the branch would hold.
</p><p>Meanwhile, we had planned a short vacation to Kerala. I hoped the eggs would be laid before we left. But the birds, still busy with construction, showed no signs of completing the nest.
</p><p>On the day of our departure, I had to shut the window. As I carefully pushed it closed, disaster struck. Just a moment of carelessness — and the window edge grazed the nest. My heart sank. There it lay on the ground — the labour of two little birds over many days, undone in an instant.
</p><p>I left for the vacation with a heavy heart. Gone were my dreams of returning to find fledglings fluttering on the branches.

                                      </p></div><div id="content-body-69613951" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Having spent my formative years as a boarder and then a lifetime in uniform, I found myself brimming with social energy upon superannuation. Naturally, I was drawn into the sprawling, chaotic world of what is colloquially known as “WhatsApp University”.
</p><p>In no time, I was added to a plethora of groups: my class group, the school alumni forum, NDA squadron, course mates, battalion groups — the list grew longer than a soldier’s kit list. I soon realised that hours of my day were vanishing into the black hole of endless messages, emojis, forwarded gyaan, and the predictable avalanche of good mornings.
</p><p>Frustrated, I decided to seek help from an old comrade and dear friend, now settled in Patiala. Known for his discipline and razor-sharp time management, he had always been the sort who would get things done before the deadline. His life post-retirement was a masterclass in balance. His office bore a blunt sign: “Mobiles Not Permitted Inside.” As a boss, he would visibly bristle at anyone glancing at their phone mid-meeting — offenders were often shown the door, sometimes permanently. He was known to be a hard taskmaster and had the knack for getting things done before time. He was endowed with meticulous time management skills. He divided the 24 hours of the day into hours of physical fitness, work, and quality time with family. Over a well-earned Patiala peg, I asked him the pressing question: “How do you handle this WhatsApp madness?”
</p><p>He smiled and shared what I now call the “Patiala Protocol” — his operating manual for staying sane in the age of digital deluge.
</p><p>“It’s not rocket science,” he began. “I’ve confined all WhatsApp activity to a single hour — between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. — while I enjoy my tea with the family. That’s it. No pressure, no guilt, and certainly no notifications pinging all day. I don’t do ritualistic greetings — no ‘good mornings’, ‘happy birthdays’, or ‘happy anniversaries’ unless it’s personal. Too many get it wrong anyway — wishing birthdays on wedding anniversaries and vice versa.” He added, ‘I know of many instances when so-called well-wishers wished the wrong person or conveyed a ‘happy birthday’ on a person’s wedding anniversary. I always greet or convey condolences personally.’ </p><p>He went on: “All group notifications are silenced. I never post or forward anything. I scroll quickly, pick what’s useful, and move on. I avoid debates on politics, religion, or gender topics. I don’t get offended by posts I disagree with. Why should I? My peace of mind is worth more than a meme. Now, this leaves me with plenty of time for my other productive hobbies of reading and writing. His philosophy was simple — low engagement, high relevance, zero drama.” I left his home lighter in spirit and grateful for the clarity he offered. In navigating WhatsApp University, it turns out, the trick isn’t to respond faster — it’s to respond less, but live more.</p><p>advityanidhi14@gmail.com</p><div id="arthardpv"></div><div></div><div><div id="artproduct2"></div></div><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/Hindu_Desktop_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/Hindu_Desktop_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid05, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid05, publisher: The Hindu --></div><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Mweb_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Mweb_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle05, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle05, publisher: The Hindu --></div></div></div><div><div><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_RT, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_RT, publisher: The Hindu --></div></div><div><div id="articledivtrendD"></div></div><div><div id="articledivtrendM"></div></div></div></div></div><div class="container article-section"><div><div data-id="69661810" data-title="The organic imperative" data-url="https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/open-page/the-organic-imperative/article69661810.ece"><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --></div><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --></div><h1 class="title" itemprop="name">
The organic imperative

                    The effects of regular usage of pesticides can be devastating.

                                      </p></div><div id="content-body-69661810" itemprop="articleBody"><p><span class="drop-caps">O</span>rganic food is often derided as being expensive, which it can be, and elitist, which it isn’t, the focus in such categorisation being on the consumer. Yet, there is little understanding of the systemic and human consequences of conventional agriculture, as chemical-centric farming is termed. For instance, there is little acknowledgement of what a farming family endures in their daily life when supplying the market with produce that is grown with a cocktail of chemical fertilizers, herbicides, fungicides, and insecticides and the unintended consequences of having these poisons lying around in the farm or their home.</p><p>The agrochemical stores that sell these products almost never offers safety gloves or advise the farmer on personal safety. The safe-application dosage is provided in gross — and, I would argue, negligent — approximation. As a consequence, it is common to see farm hands fill up the sprayer with water, add the chemical — often a deadly poison — with bare hands, load the tanks on their back and spray without any sort of protective covering. While some crops require less sprays, others, such as cotton, demand heavy dosages of pesticides and the outcome is expected, if depressing. Since everyone uses these chemicals with little caution, it is seen as the norm and not unusual in the least.
</p><p>Young farmers taking to the profession follow suit which is particularly disheartening to see, for it is highly probable that the deleterious effects of regular usage — disruption of the endocrine system, genetic damage, alteration to the functioning of the pituitary gland, fertility and birth defects, cancers, lung ailments, autoimmune conditions, among others — will visit them in some years. The choices of chemicals available in the nearby agrochemicals shop and toxicity of “crop protection” products, as the basket of pesticides is euphemistically referred to, are utterly frightening to contemplate: weedicides such as Glyphosate, considered to be a possible carcinogen, were introduced in India a couple of decades ago and are used widely as a substitute to manual labour in weed control, broadening the number of highly dangerous chemicals farmhands will be exposed to.
</p><p>The impact of these chemicals on wildlife — insects, birds, mammals, reptiles — is now known as a result of well-documented published research, yet the learnings have been ignored in the making of policy decisions, even when the effect on human food supply is likely to be acutely affected in future. As an example, it is known that neonicotinoids, a class of systemic insecticides widely used in agriculture and veterinary medicine to control pests, are dangerous neurotoxic chemicals for bees and other pollinators, yet few countries around the world are able to fend off the lobbying efforts of the pesticide industry and ban them.
</p><h4 class="sub_head">Corrupting the food chain</h4><p>It is now also understood that chemical fertilizers and pesticides leach into groundwater, streams, lakes and rivers, affecting the aquatic biota and the food chain all the way to mammals. A pioneering study done over 30 years ago found that organochlorine pesticide residues were determined in otter faeces from nine catchment regions in southwestern England from 1989 to 1991. Following the scientific principle of bio-accumulation (accumulation of a pollutant like a pesticide in tissues of a living organism), humans are likely to be affected, particularly in the less-developed countries where water treatment at the municipality level is shoddy or non-existent.</p><p>The environmental media and NGOs have challenged the pesticide industry and rightly asked hard questions, despite little support from the regulators. Yet, there are further troubling questions: what happens to an empty pesticide bottle or packet? The anecdotal answers are worrying. Take bottles: instances of farmers living close to streams rinsing these bottles in stream water to use the ‘last drop’ in their sprayer are well known, which, in turn, releases toxicity into the stream and ultimately into the human body, as species such as fish and crabs are consumed. There is an active plastic recycling economy, in which aggregators visit farms and buy such used bottles which are then sent to be recycled to another product. When we consider the fumes breathed in and the exposure to toxins by thousands of poor workers in the informal recycling sector as these bottles are melted or converted into plastic chips, the supply chain and its unintended consequences becomes clearer. None of this is documented or even satisfactorily understood, nor is there any ongoing study that could provide clues to the scale and insidiousness of the problem.
</p><p>Buying organic food is perhaps the optimal solution, as increasing demand from consumers will encourage the transition for some farmers, either individually or as farmer producer organisations, to sustainable ways of farming. The valid question often asked is about the genuineness of the organic produce we see online or on shelves. The purchase of products with organic certification is one solution, yet a better way is to read up about organic movements and farmers and to seek out those who farm organically because of their beliefs and value systems while ensuring healthy profits; social media has enough leads to offer.
</p><p>Many of us desire to make a social impact, perhaps by supporting an indigent student, a local NGO near our homes or a waste collection effort. What is perhaps not entirely evident is that becoming an organic food consumer is perhaps the most sustained contribution we could make to the environment and, on a larger and broader canvas, to society.

There is a deeply disturbing serial currently airing on a Hindi general entertainment channel, centred on the character of a kind, talented, and good-hearted young woman who is relentlessly humiliated because of her weight.</p><p>From the very beginning, she is taunted by her mother and grandmother for not being slim — despite their knowledge that a pregnancy-related medicine made weight loss impossible for her. Then follows not just casual body shaming, but sustained psychological torment, emotional degradation, and outright abuse by her in-laws — presented as a woman’s duty to “adjust” and “win hearts”.
</p><p>A wealthy businessman arranges her marriage to his son, praising her <i>sanskaars</i>. But the groom, diabetic and secretly in love with the bride’s model cousin, refuses to accept her. He avoids her, sleeps on the sofa, while his mother and aunt connive to frame her as clumsy and incompetent. They engineer her every mistake, then punish her for it — all the while she tries to prove her worth like the archetypal docile bahu, with a bowed head and a constant stream of apologies.</p><p>In a recent and deeply disturbing episode, she is forced to pose as a servant when a domineering relative visits. She is insulted, spanked with a rod, and nearly trapped into spending the night with a hired actor posing as her husband — all in a calculated scheme to drive her out. Yet, she endures this cruelty in silence, convinced that suffering is the road to love.
</p><p>A new episode reached a new low. It humiliated not one, but two women, turning their pain into a farce for viewer amusement. A village girl chosen by the visiting grandaunt to marry the hero (unaware he’s married) is pitted against the wife. The episode ends without justice or consequence — only the image of a woman broken by public mockery. One feels sick watching it.
</p><h4 class="sub_head">Evil message
</h4><p>What are we teaching viewers — especially young women — through such shows? That if you are overweight or from a rural background, you must grovel for love and acceptance? That abuse by in-laws must be endured in the name of parampara? That silence, shame, and submission are signs of virtue? And what message are we sending to in-laws — that cruelty is permissible as long as it’s cloaked in tradition?
</p><p>This is not entertainment. This is emotional abuse disguised as morality. The show doesn’t challenge oppression, but romanticises it. It rewards toxic behaviour, even painting abusers as concerned, well-meaning elders.
</p><p>Worse, it normalises violence. Every humiliation the young woman suffers is presented as a test of character. But acceptance by whom? A mother-in-law who hires a man to seduce her daughter-in-law? A grandaunt who hits her with a rod for minor mistakes? These aren’t “family trials” — they are criminal acts.
</p><p>In the real world, any woman subjected to this level of abuse would suffer long-lasting psychological damage. But on TV, these acts are framed as character-building, as if pain is the price of acceptance.
</p><p>If the show truly intended to critique social cruelty, it could have shown the young woman resisting, reclaiming her dignity, or getting in-laws who value her. The message could have been one of strength, not submission.
</p><p>This show is a regressive, damaging portrayal of Indian womanhood. We cannot let mainstream media glorify abuse in the name of <i>sanskaars</i>.</p><p>As viewers and citizens, all should strongly protest the normalisation of familial abuse, and call for a boycott of such content.
</p><p>Channels must rethink their programming. They cannot promote humiliation, cruelty, and misogyny as tradition.
</p><p>The show must be stopped before it harms.</p><p>vineykirpal@gmail.com</p><div id="arthardpv"></div><div></div><div><div id="artproduct2"></div></div><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/Hindu_Desktop_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/Hindu_Desktop_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid05, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid05, publisher: The Hindu --></div><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Mweb_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Mweb_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle05, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle05, publisher: The Hindu --></div></div></div><div><div><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_RT, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_RT, publisher: The Hindu --></div></div><div><div id="articledivtrendD"></div></div><div><div id="articledivtrendM"></div></div></div></div></div>
