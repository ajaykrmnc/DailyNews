<div class="premium-label print-hide"><span>Premium</span></div></h1><div class="articlebodycontent col-xl-9 col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-12" id="content-body-69666066" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Celebration to tragedy</p><p>I would like to share my grief with the family members of the persons who died and also the injured during the celebrations of RCB’s win in the Indian Premier League 2025. It is distressing to write such a letter. The roadshow was unwarranted. Basic crowd control measures were lacking. There was hardly a stretcher or an ambulance in sight and the number of policemen was insufficient. The fact that lakhs of people had converged around the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium, unmindful of the risks involved, also highlights the degree of unemployment in the country. There was no need for such a hype over the victory of the RCB. It only shows how a great sport has lapsed into a commercial enterprise, so much so that whenever a boundary is hit or a wicket is taken, there are cheerleaders dancing. To add to it, players who receive a handsome amount also easily give in to advertisements. It is time regulatory measures are brought in, either by the BCCI or the government, to retain the quality of the sport. It would also not be an exaggeration to underscore the point that the Opposition political parties are trying to gain mileage out of this immense tragedy.

​Same page: on monetary policy, the RBI, the Government   
</h1><h2 class="sub-title">The RBI and the government are now aligned on boosting growth </h2><div class="articlebodycontent col-xl-9 col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-12" id="content-body-69665242" itemprop="articleBody"><p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Monetary Policy Committee’s decisions, on Friday, show that the central bank is now unequivocally choosing growth in the perennial growth-inflation trade-off. This is the correct approach at this time. The first major decision was to cut the repo rate by 50 basis points to 5.5%. It comes on the back of two cuts of 25 basis points each, in February and April. With the latest retail inflation coming in at a 69-month low, and generally exhibiting a subdued trend, price stability has now been relegated as a secondary concern. These rate cuts will, once the banks transmit them to borrowers, make it cheaper for companies and consumers to borrow to invest and purchase. The second major decision, of slashing the cash reserve ratio by 100 basis points, will help with the transmission of the rate cuts. The less that banks have to keep with themselves, as stipulated by the cash reserve ratio, the more they can lend out — and now at lower rates. It is worth noting, however, that the central bank has again changed its stance. In April, it had moved from being neutral to being accommodative, indicating that it was inclined to cut rates further. It has now moved back to neutral, meaning more rate cuts in the short term are unlikely, unless growth falls well short of expectations. This is a sensible stance to take, given the vast uncertainties that the Indian and global economies are facing. The neutral stance also means that the RBI is equally predisposed to raise rates again in the event of an unforeseen and sustained spike in prices. The monsoon is yet to fully play out, after all.</p><p>The timing of these decisions is sound. Inflation is low and not likely to jump any time soon if current factors remain unchanged. Further, there are no major elections now that would otherwise have necessitated a pre-emptive strong grip on price levels. On the other hand, growth is lower than it could be. The RBI has projected growth in the current financial year 2025-26 to be 6.5%, which is no faster than what the government provisionally estimated for the previous year. Fiscal policy in terms of government spending has reached the limit of the stimulus it can provide. After a decade of increasing outlays, government capital expenditure can at best be maintained at the level it is at, but cannot reasonably be expected to grow much further. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and officials in the Ministry of Finance have indicated as much. Apart from developmental and social priorities, the government now has additional defence spending to account for. Monetary policy has to step up and boost growth, and it is good to see the RBI and the government on the same page.</p><div class="fragmentcontent lazy" data-fragment-url="https://www.thehindu.com/fragment/getregionallist/69665242" id="reginallist"></div><div class="articleblock-container" id="arthardpv"></div><div class="spliter pt-0 mb-0 print-hide"></div><div class="article-ad two-side text-ad print-hide"><div class="ad-text" id="artproduct2" style="display: none;"></div></div><div class="d-none d-lg-block d-xl-block"><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/Hindu_Desktop_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/Hindu_Desktop_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid05, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid05, publisher: The Hindu --></div><div class="d-block d-sm-none"><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Mweb_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Mweb_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle05, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle05, publisher: The Hindu --></div></div></div><div class="print-hide col-xl-3 col-lg-4 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-12"><div class="d-none d-sm-block d-lg-block d-xl-block"><div class="adbg"><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_RT, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_RT, publisher: The Hindu --></div></div><div class="d-none d-sm-block d-lg-block d-xl-block popular-premium-tabs"><div id="articledivtrendD"></div></div><div class="d-block d-sm-none"><div id="articledivtrendM"></div></div></div></div></div><div class="container article-section"><div class="row"><div class="col-xl-9 col-lg-8 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-12 opinion" data-id="69665973" data-title="Water management in India needs a new course" data-url="https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/water-management-in-india-needs-a-new-course/article69665973.ece"><div class="d-none d-sm-block d-lg-block d-xl-block artinrstl-ad"><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --></div><div class="d-block d-sm-none artinrstl-ad"><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --></div><h1 class="title" itemprop="name">

The year 2025 has also been declared the International Year of Glaciers’ Preservation by the United Nations (March 21 is World Day for Glaciers, observed for the first time this year), which also marks the beginning of a ‘Decade of Action on Cryospheric Science’ (2025-34).</p><p>There have been a series of global events on various issues that have included the theme of ‘water and glaciers – from science to policy’ and the need for regional and local actions. The United Nations World Water Development Report 2025, which was on the theme ‘Mountain and Glaciers – Water Towers’, has drawn global attention to the importance of mountain waters including alpine glaciers in the sustainable development of mountain regions and downstream societies. This focus is relevant especially in the context of a rapidly changing mountain cryosphere, which will have a profound impact on downstream water resources. The cryosphere concerns the frozen portions of the earth.
</p><p class="referpara"><strong>
        Also read | <b>The world needs to stop taking water for granted </b></strong></p><p>The year 2025 is also the midway point in the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (2021-2030), which proposes the vision of ‘Science we need for the ocean we want’. Rising coastal and marine pollution, coastal hazards, rising sea surface temperature and sea level rise and the loss of marine biodiversity are the subjects of concern that have been highlighted in this ocean decade.
</p><h4 class="sub_head">A link that is overlooked
</h4><p>Water connects both these geographical entities as there is a clear upstream-downstream linkage. Human activities upstream impact the downstream environment. Although the hydrological cycle operates independently as a natural process, at the sub-system level, it is modified due to human activities. These include damming and the diversion of water from rivers for agriculture and other purposes, the drawing of water from surface water bodies and groundwater aquifers, and the pollution of water bodies. All these changes result in the alteration of freshwater flow to coastal areas and the open ocean, thereby affecting the marine environment.
</p><p>Current water management practices often overlook this linkage, which is now emerging as a major global concern. In recognition of the need for integrated land, freshwater and coastal and ocean resource management, the concept of a Source to Sea (S2S) approach was proposed as a part of the Manila Declaration, in January 2012.
</p><div class="also-read print-hide" data-ga-label="AlsoReadArticle"><div class="element"><div class="title">
									The role of communities in conserving water</div><div class="picture"></div></div></div><p>This declaration focuses on ‘Furthering the Implementation of the Global Programme of Action for the Protection of the Marine Environment from Land-based Activities’. Adopted by 65 countries, it proposed “to improve cooperation and coordination at all levels to deal with issues related to oceans, coasts, islands and their associated watersheds, by applying integrated management such as ‘ridge to reef’ approaches, including by involving stakeholders and developing innovative solutions to improve or resolve identified problems”. The Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI) also launched the Action Platform for Source-to-Sea Management initiatives on September 1, 2014.
</p><p>The aim was to help decision-makers, stakeholders, and freshwater, coastal and marine experts to connect, cooperate and promote better practices, and also facilitate and enhance international cooperation. Since January 2025, the International Union for Conservation of Nature hosts this platform.
</p><p>The basic premise of the S2S approach is the understanding that ‘Earth is a unique system’ and that fresh and marine water systems are part of a single continuum. This approach takes a critical view of current water management and governance arrangements which use different strategies for different segments of the same water body. In 2012, the analysis report of the Land-based Pollution Sources Working Group ( United Nations University) suggested two major adjustments for the approach to project management. The first was to overcome the traditional divide of water or, rather, the isolated consideration of rivers, aquifers, lakes, large marine ecosystems and open oceans. The second was to apply a socio-ecological system scale in design and scientific analysis including transboundary diagnostic analysis and causal chain analysis to arrive at solutions. Both these suggestions deserve the attention of all countries. The working group was executing a project of the Global Environmental Facility (GEF)-International Water (IW) Science to enhance the use of science in international water projects in order to improve project results.
</p><h4 class="sub_head">Problems with India’s water management
</h4><p>India faces several challenges in the matter of water management. These include spatial heterogeneity in the availability of water, unequal access, increasing pollution, climate change, and conflicts. A NITI Aayog study (2018) reported that water stress might affect 600 million people with a likely loss of 6% of GDP due to water stress. The Aquaduct Water Risk Atlas of the World Resources Institute observes that India is one of the countries which could face extreme water stress, impacting agricultural production and disrupting the economy. In 2022, the Central Pollution Control Board identified 311 polluted river stretches (of varying severity) along 279 rivers in 30 States and Union Territories. India produces an average of 1.7 lakh tonnes of solid waste a day of which around 53% is treated. A significant amount of untreated waste finds its way into waterbodies. India uses an average of 60.5% of extractable ground water resources, with States such as Haryana, Punjab and Rajasthan reporting more than 100% use. Around 25% of groundwater assessment units are under various categories of risk. Over 60% of irrigated farming and 85% of drinking water are derived from groundwater reserves. Groundwater quality is also declining. Water security faces a growing threat.
</p><div class="also-read print-hide" data-ga-label="AlsoReadArticle"><div class="element"><div class="title">
									Water, an instrument to build world peace</div><div class="picture"></div></div></div><p>India’s water management problems are a result of a fragmented and sectoral approach. Another reason is because rivers and other waterbodies are often inter-State and multiple political jurisdictions are involved in administering the same waterbody. There are four different governance systems to address natural commons such as rivers and water bodies. Private property owners operate on the local/panchayat/village governance commons; local government operates on the State governance commons; the State government operates on the national governance commons, and the national government operates on the global governance commons. The challenge is to coordinate activities under different tiers, have them as a part of the nested governance systems and devise an appropriate water policy for the country.
</p><h4 class="sub_head">An approach on the fringes
</h4><p>The first national water policy was introduced in 1987. Subsequently, there have been attempts to modify and include other features. In 2015, a committee was constituted to restructure the Central Water Commission and the Central Ground Water Board to form the National Water Commission. In 2019, the Ministry of Jal Shakti set up a committee of independent experts to draft a national water policy. It has suggested policy recommendations to address challenges. States have also prepared water policies.
</p><p>Despite these initiatives, the S2S approach has yet to gain the attention of policy planners. There are two case study initiatives being contemplated following the S2S approach. The first addresses the nutrient management of Delhi waterbodies under the S2S platform and the second is a proposed project under the S2S Future programme to examine relationships between human settlement and the S2S landscape in the Indo-Gangetic basin.
</p><p>It is important to have a shift in favour of the S2S approach adopting a social ecological system framework for coordinated implementation of the freshwater and marine Sustainable Development Goals (6 and 14). The focus must be on linking targets 6.5 (integrated water resource management) and 14.1 (land-based activities) by involving all stakeholders, reducing the gap between science, policy and execution and facilitating innovative interventions.

​Insular, paranoid: on Donald Trump, the U.S., legal migration
</h1><h2 class="sub-title">Donald Trump is turning the U.S. into a self-doubting republic </h2><div class="articlebodycontent col-xl-9 col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-12" id="content-body-69665647" itemprop="articleBody"><p>President Donald Trump’s decision to ban citizens from 12 countries from entering the United States, citing national security concerns, is yet another attempt by his five-month-old administration to tear down legal migration. Mr. Trump’s decision in 2017, during his first term, to ban citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries had triggered chaos and protests at America’s airports, evoked criticism of the unstated racism and xenophobia, and led to legal challenges. This time, Mr. Trump has focused on mostly West Asia and Africa. Citizens from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen would be banned, while people from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela will face restrictions. The ban applies only to people outside the U.S. but those with active visas who leave the country could face difficulty during re-entry. Mr. Trump argued that the ban, which came days after the arrest of an Egyptian man for carrying out an attack on a group honouring the Gaza hostages, would help prevent terrorist attacks and keep out those who overstay their visas. Egypt, a close American ally, and Spain, which saw 20,000 of its citizens overstay their visas in 2023, are not on the list, but Chad, whose visa overstay number is as low as 400, is.</p><p>Since his swearing-in as the President, in January, for the second time, Mr. Trump has taken a series of measures to crack down on migration. He has suspended the asylum system at the southern border and ended temporary legal residency for Haitians, Venezuelans and Cubans. He has also removed the legal status of thousands of foreign students and instructed U.S. diplomatic missions to pause scheduling new visa interviews as his administration prepares to vet the social media handles of students and scholars. His policies targeting international students have already spread chaos and uncertainty across America’s universities. Now, the outright ban on citizens from a group of countries reinforces the erosion of the self-image of the U.S. — “the shining city on a hill” as Ronald Reagan once called it — as a pluralistic, open society. Mr. Trump’s claim that immigrants bring crime into the U.S. is ill-founded. Many of the people seeking entry into the U.S., from countries that had seen American military intervention, such as Haiti and Afghanistan, are fleeing war, persecution and systemic violence. They are not national security threats but victims in search of refuge. By shutting America’s doors on them, and immigrants in general, Mr. Trump is not making the U.S. safer. Rather, he is turning a country, which historically welcomed immigration and has benefited from it, into an insular, paranoid, self-doubting republic.</p><div class="fragmentcontent lazy" data-fragment-url="https://www.thehindu.com/fragment/getregionallist/69665647" id="reginallist"></div><div class="articleblock-container" id="arthardpv"></div><div class="spliter pt-0 mb-0 print-hide"></div><div class="article-ad two-side text-ad print-hide"><div class="ad-text" id="artproduct2" style="display: none;"></div></div><div class="d-none d-lg-block d-xl-block"><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/Hindu_Desktop_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/Hindu_Desktop_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid05, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid05, publisher: The Hindu --></div><div class="d-block d-sm-none"><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Mweb_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Mweb_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle05, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle05, publisher: The Hindu --></div></div></div><div class="print-hide col-xl-3 col-lg-4 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-12"><div class="d-none d-sm-block d-lg-block d-xl-block"><div class="adbg"><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_RT, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_RT, publisher: The Hindu --></div></div><div class="d-none d-sm-block d-lg-block d-xl-block popular-premium-tabs"><div id="articledivtrendD"></div></div><div class="d-block d-sm-none"><div id="articledivtrendM"></div></div></div></div></div><div class="container article-section"><div class="row"><div class="col-xl-9 col-lg-8 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-12 opinion" data-id="69665917" data-title="Maintaining India’s progress in food safety standards" data-url="https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/maintaining-indias-progress-in-food-safety-standards/article69665917.ece"><div class="d-none d-sm-block d-lg-block d-xl-block artinrstl-ad"><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --></div><div class="d-block d-sm-none artinrstl-ad"><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --></div><h1 class="title" itemprop="name">

                                      </p></div><div class="articlebodycontent col-xl-9 col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-12" id="content-body-69665917" itemprop="articleBody"><p>This year, the theme of World Food Safety Day, which is observed on June 7, is “Food Safety: Science in Action”. It is an opportune moment to reflect on India’s journey, evolving from a narrow focus on preventing food adulteration to embracing a more comprehensive, science-based approach to food safety. But despite the progress, there are gaps and challenges.</p><p>India’s journey on food safety began with the Prevention of Food Adulteration (PFA) Act of 1954, which viewed food safety as a simple, binary issue — food being adulterated or not. This approach treated all contaminants alike, whether they were intentionally added adulterants, food additives, pesticide residues, veterinary drug residues, or even naturally occurring toxins. The quantity consumed was not considered.</p><p>The turning point was the enactment of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, which established the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI). Drawing on international best practices, particularly those of the Codex Alimentarius Commission, the FSSAI adopted a risk-based approach to food safety. This included setting maximum residue limits (MRLs) for pesticides, defining safe levels for food additives, and adopting standards for contaminants and veterinary drug residues.
</p><div class="also-read print-hide" data-ga-label="AlsoReadArticle"><div class="element"><div class="title">
									Why are some packaged foods under the scanner? Explained</div><div class="picture"></div></div></div><p>By 2020, the FSSAI managed to develop and align India’s food safety standards so that they were almost on a par with those in advanced countries. However, this rapid progress also exposed certain weaknesses.
</p><h4 class="sub_head">The gaps and challenges in risk assessment
</h4><p>A fundamental issue is the lack of India-specific toxicological studies. Most safety standards, including MRLs for pesticides and acceptable daily intake (ADI) values for food additives, are based on international data, which may not accurately reflect Indian dietary habits, agricultural practices or environmental conditions. The absence of total diet study (TDS) further complicates risk assessment. Such studies are essential to assess the cumulative exposure of consumers to various contaminants through their entire diet. Without TDS, India relies on fragmented data, which weaken the scientific basis of its safety standards.
</p><p>Another challenge is effective risk communication. Technical terms such as MRLs and ADIs are expressed in minute quantities (parts per million, or ppm, or parts per billion, or ppb) – that are difficult for consumers to understand. These can lead to confusion, especially when safety limits are revised. For instance, the decision to revise the MRL for pesticides from a highly restrictive 0.01 mg/kg to a more practical 0.1 mg/kg led to public concern, with many interpreting it as a reduction in safety.
</p><h4 class="sub_head">An example of legacy issues
</h4><p>A persistent legacy issue is the regulation of monosodium glutamate (MSG), a flavour enhancer that has been extensively studied and consistently found to be safe. Since 1971, the Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) has declared MSG safe for consumption. In 1987, the JECFA allocated an “ADI not specified” status to MSG. All countries follow this global consensus now.
</p><div class="also-read print-hide" data-ga-label="AlsoReadArticle"><div class="element"><div class="title">
									In food we trust: laying out health and hygiene norms</div><div class="picture"></div></div></div><p>In India, MSG regulations have evolved significantly. Initially, MSG was only allowed in meat products, but its use has gradually been permitted in all foods, but with a mandatory warning label that it is unsafe for infants. This is in sharp contrast to other countries, where MSG is recognised as a safe food additive, and outdated warning labels have been removed.
</p><p>The warning label in India is misleading because glutamates (naturally occurring compounds chemically identical to MSG) are abundant in everyday foods such as tomato, mushroom and garlic, as well as breast milk. As a result, consumers are often left with the mistaken belief that MSG is inherently harmful, leading to unnecessary fear and confusion. As a result, consumers are often left with the mistaken belief that MSG is inherently harmful, leading to unnecessary fear and confusion.
</p><p>Such a legacy approach contradicts global scientific consensus and exposes the challenge of balancing consumer concerns with scientific evidence. It also reflects a broader problem, which is India’s tendency to allow some outdated regulations to persist, even when they conflict with current scientific understanding.
</p><h4 class="sub_head">A path to greater scientific rigor
</h4><p>India has made significant strides in food safety, but sustaining this progress requires targeted efforts. Investing in India-specific research, including localised toxicological studies and a comprehensive TDS, is vital to understand cumulative exposure to contaminants. Risk communication should be improved by simplifying scientific messages and replacing confusing labels, such as those for MSG, with clear, evidence-based information. Strengthening the capacity of risk assessors through continuous training ensures that they stay updated with the latest science for sound decision-making. Regular reviews and updating standards in line with new research, while maintaining transparency, are essential. Finally, building public trust through open and consistent engagement with stakeholders including industry, consumers, and the public is key. These steps will help India uphold and advance its commitment to safe, science-based food systems that protect public health and promote informed choices.

									Explained | Misleading food ads and regulations to curtail them</div><div class="picture"></div></div></div><p>The FSSAI has laid a strong foundation for food safety in India, but sustaining this progress requires a commitment to science, transparency, and public education. Regulatory decisions must be driven by evidence rather than public fears or out-dated perceptions. As we look ahead, India must continue to balance scientific rigour with effective risk communication, ensuring that consumers are informed, confident, and protected without harbouring unnecessary fear.

<p>Shiva, the ascetic form of the Hindu divine, has a long history. The Vedic Rudra (1000 BC) is distinct from the later Puranic Shiva (500 AD), who lives atop Mount Kailasa with his wife and children. The Vedic Rudra has a bow, not a trident. He shoots arrows at Prajapati Brahma. He destroys the yagna, when not invited. And he is given leftover offerings. But by the time of the Mahabharata, he is a powerful god invoked by Amba and Ashwatthama to help them destroy their enemies.</p>
<p>Ramayana tells for the first time the story of Shiva catching the Ganga river that descends from the sky on the locks of his hair. The Gudimallam linga shows a thick-haired man, probably an early form of Shiva, with a hunted wild goat in his hand. Clearly carved Shiva-linga started appearing around 2,200 years ago. The linga later was shown with one face, or four faces, as if the formless is taking form.</p>
<p>About 1,200 years ago, icons and aniconic forms of Shiva began to appear even in Vietnam and coastal Thailand and the island of Java, indicating the spread of a Pashupata cult. Kings invoked Shiva to become as powerful as him. Their capital was equated to the mountain abode of Shiva. The famous Chola temple of Brihadeshwara was built 1,000 years ago.</p>
<p>But the stories in the Purana show a different Shiva: less imperial, and more a wise simpleton (Bhola). An asura saw that Shiva had the power to burn Kama, the god of desire and reduce him to ash. He wanted the same power. Shiva gave it to him. He used this power to burn all his enemies. He terrified everyone by threatening to touch them. He decided to touch Shiva and reduce him to ash. Shiva ran from this crazy asura, not knowing what to do. Vishnu came to Shiva’s rescue and tricked the asura to touch his own head. Thus, the asura was reduced to a pile of ash. This is the story of Bhasma-asura, the ash-demon, who abuses Shiva’s generosity. In popular lore, Shiva is a god who is easy to please (Ashutosh), and such stories are used by the marketing departments of religions to popularise their faith.</p>
<p>Rival religions argued that Shiva is gullible (bhola), unaware of the ways of the world, and so attracts thieves and scoundrels who take advantage of him. That he treats gods and demons equally because he is equanimous and doesn’t differentiate between things, lacking a moral compass. Shiva can be compared to the naïve activist who believes in charity and dole, and refuses to see that while some people use the help to uplift themselves from poverty, others use it to wallow in laziness. To be clear, Shiva is not coming from ‘saving the world’—he is simply generous with what he is too blissful to bother with, or care about, property.</p>
<p>There are stories of Ravana, the rakshasa-king, who takes advantage of Shiva’s gullibility and asks him for all the powers in the world. Ravana even asked for Mount Kailash, the abode of Shiva. Shiva gave it to him. So Ravana picked up the mountain and began carrying it southwards towards his island kingdom. As the mountain moved, Shiva’s wife and children began to scream in terror and begged Shiva to save them. Shiva immediately pressed his toe against the slope of the mountain, trapping Ravana under the mountain’s weight. Ravana then begged Shiva to release him, which the compassionate god did instantly. While the story ends with Ravana learning his lesson, the former part shows how greedy men constantly enjoying the company of the generous. The greedy see contentment as weakness to be taken advantage of to generate their own wealth. The person who is content is open to exploitation. We see the mess created by Shiva’s unthinking generosity. He is not thinking about the consequences of his action. He is just giving away what he is being asked for, because he holds on to nothing.</p>
<p>These stories are a reminder of the dangers of generosity and charity. The act may be noble, but can be abused by the cunning trickster. It matters who is receiving the charity. Contentment allows us to see other people’s insecurities and cravings, objectively, without the filter of our insecurities. The act of giving has consequences. Distribution of surplus wealth and power without discretion leads to anarchy and chaos. Who is responsible for that chaos?</p>
<p>Contentment does not mean the end of responsibility or accountability. Contentment does not mean indifference. It means having the space to look beyond our needs and wants at the ways of the world—the hunger of the asura, the insecurity of the deva. While we may want to help them, they may receive help in whatever way they wish. Or maybe, Shiva sees far ahead than anyone else. He knows those who try to trick him will fail anyway. For Shiva, these demons, and gods, who take advantage of him, who mock him, are the gullible ones. They do not recognise that he is Time (Kala) who strikes fear (Bhairava) in everyone’s heart. For eventually everything perishes—consumed by time.</p>
