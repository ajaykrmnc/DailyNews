The Bandung Conference, held in Indonesia in April 1955, was a pivotal moment in the history of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). Twenty-nine newly independent Asian and African nations gathered to discuss issues of common concern, including colonialism, racism, and economic development. Jawaharlal Nehru, then Prime Minister of India, played a leading role in organizing and shaping the conference. The Bandung Conference marked a turning point in international relations, as it signaled the rise of the developing world and its determination to pursue an independent path in the Cold War era. It laid the foundation for NAM, which became a major force in promoting peace, disarmament, and economic cooperation among developing countries. The conference highlighted India's leadership role in championing the cause of the developing world and its commitment to a multi-polar world order.

**5. Bhagavad Gita Paragraph (Based on Day 152 of the Year - 2025):**

Since today is the 152nd day of the year, we will look at 152nd Paragraph of Gita.

Based on several versions of Gita it is in the 11th Adhyaya or Chapter called "Vishvarupa Darshana Yoga".

"Seeing Your infinite form, with numerous mouths and eyes, mighty arms, thighs, feet, and bellies, and fearful with many teeth, all the worlds, as well as myself, are greatly disturbed."

**(Context):** This verse describes Arjuna's awe and fear as he witnesses the cosmic form of Krishna, a manifestation of the divine that transcends human comprehension. It signifies the overwhelming nature of ultimate reality and the humility one feels in the face of such power.

**(Relevance):** For UPSC aspirants, this highlights the importance of recognizing the limits of human knowledge and understanding when dealing with complex issues. It also underscores the need for humility and respect when engaging with different perspectives. In life, it reminds us that the universe is vast and mysterious, and we should approach it with a sense of wonder and reverence.

**7. LeetCode Problem & Solution (Day 152 of the Year):**

Let's assume LeetCode Problem number 152 is: **Maximum Product Subarray**

**Problem Description:**

Given an integer array `nums`, find a contiguous non-empty subarray within the array that has the largest product, and return the product.  The test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.

**C++ Solution:**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int maxProduct(vector<int>& nums) {
    if (nums.empty()) return 0;

    int max_so_far = nums[0];
    int min_so_far = nums[0];
    int result = nums[0];

    for (int i = 1; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
        int curr = nums[i];
        int temp_max = max({curr, max_so_far * curr, min_so_far * curr});
        min_so_far = min({curr, max_so_far * curr, min_so_far * curr});

        max_so_far = temp_max;

        result = max(result, max_so_far);
    }

    return result;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {2, 3, -2, 4};
    cout << "Maximum product subarray: " << maxProduct(nums) << endl; // Output: 6

    vector<int> nums2 = {-2, 0, -1};
    cout << "Maximum product subarray: " << maxProduct(nums2) << endl; // Output: 0

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Initialization:**  We initialize `max_so_far` and `min_so_far` with the first element of the array. These variables track the maximum and minimum product seen so far, ending at the current index. `result` stores the overall maximum product found.
2.  **Iteration:** We iterate through the array starting from the second element.
3.  **Update `max_so_far` and `min_so_far`:**
    *   For each element `curr`, the new `max_so_far` can be one of three possibilities: `curr` itself, `max_so_far * curr`, or `min_so_far * curr`. We take the maximum of these three.  The same logic applies for calculating `min_so_far`. The key is that a negative number multiplied by the current minimum can become the new maximum, and vice-versa.  That's why we need to track both the max and min.
4.  **Update `result`:**  In each iteration, we update `result` with the maximum of the current `result` and the new `max_so_far`.
5.  **Return `result`:**  Finally, we return the overall maximum product.

This approach handles cases with negative numbers and zeros effectively.  The time complexity is O(n) because we iterate through the array once.  The space complexity is O(1) as we use a constant amount of extra space.

Have a productive and insightful day!
