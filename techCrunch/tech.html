            <h2>Apple is salvaging Image Playground with a boost from ChatGPT</h2><div class="page" id="readability-page-1"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">When Apple unveiled Image Playground last year, the company touted it as a quick and easy way to generate personalized, original images with the help of Apple Intelligence. Upon launch, the app was met with skepticism, as some users were disappointed by its limitations and low-quality results.</p>
<p>For example, one Reddit user was surprised to find that Image Playground kept generating an image of a hand with six fingers when prompted to create an “up close image of a hand.” In another instance, a user was unable to receive images of simple descriptions, such as “old man” or “flower.” </p>
<p>Some people even questioned what the point of the app was, noting that it seemed juvenile when compared to popular AI image generators. (Of course, not everybody dislikes the app; some have described it as being a fun experience.)</p>
<p>Fast-forward to this year’s WWDC, where the tech giant announced that it’s going to boost Image Playground with a ChatGPT integration, which should allow for a better, more advanced AI image generation service.</p>
<p>With the new ChatGPT integration, users will be able to access more styles that move beyond the emoji-like creations that Image Playground has become known for. </p>
<p>Images can be created in the following new styles: Oil Painting, Watercolor, Vector, Anime, and Print. In addition, people will be able to select a new “Any Style” option that allows them to describe exactly what they want. These new styles will be visible under a banner that reads “ChatGPT style.”</p>

<p>In the past, users were limited to Animation, Illustration, Sketch, and Genmoji styles.</p>
<p>Apple says that Image Playground will send a user’s description to ChatGPT to generate an image. The tech giant notes that it won’t share anything with ChatGPT without users’ permission.</p>
<p>By integrating ChatGPT into Image Playground, Apple is giving the app another shot at attracting users while positioning its AI image creation tool as a more well-rounded competitor to other similar free apps. </p>
<p>Plus, it makes sense for Apple to leverage ChatGPT to boost Image Playground, especially since the company has already tapped OpenAI’s tools in other ways. </p>
<p>Last year, Apple announced that it was bringing ChatGPT to Siri and other first-party apps and capabilities across its operating systems. With Siri, the assistant leverages ChatGPT when it’s unable to answer a question on its own or when a user specifically asks Siri to send an inquiry to ChatGPT. Apple has also integrated ChatGPT into system-wide tools like Writing Tools, allowing users to generate, rewrite, and summarize text in apps like Notes and Mail.</p>
<p>The updated Image Playground app is expected to launch alongside the release of iOS 26 this fall. </p>

<p id="speakable-summary">There are some headlines making the rounds claiming that TechCrunch is “pulling out of Europe” and shuttering its coverage of European startups. This is flat-out wrong. It misrepresents who we are, what we do, and — most of all — what we believe.</p>
<p>The recent changes at TechCrunch are not about retreat. They are about realignment and reinforcement. This new chapter is fueled by our partnership with our sister company, Foundry, which was brought under the same ownership to create a tech media entity with unparalleled global scope.</p>
<p>To be clear, Foundry is a powerhouse of international technology journalism. Its portfolio includes established and respected brands like PCWorld, Macworld, CIO, and TechAdvisor, with a vast network of journalists and deep-rooted expertise in local and regional tech ecosystems across Europe and the world.</p>
<p>The suggestion that our new ownership believes international coverage is unessential is patently false. The entire purpose of bringing TechCrunch and Foundry together is to create a stronger, more globally focused media platform.</p>
<h2 id="h-why-we-fight-for-this-beat">Why we fight for this beat</h2>
<p>Europe is where fintech regulation is rewritten, where quantum startups spin out of Max Planck labs, where climate-tech pilots become the standard for the rest of the planet. In 2024 alone, European founders raised over €40 billion; many of the unicorns we covered last year were born on this continent. If you care about the future of technology, you have to be here. And we are.</p>
<p>As we integrate the strengths of both TechCrunch and Foundry, here is our promise to the founders, investors, and readers in Europe and beyond:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Radical presence. </strong>We will be on the ground — from demo days in Tallinn to hydrogen-hub unveilings in the Basque Country — because stories look different up close.</li>
<li><strong>Relentless scrutiny.</strong> Hype dies in daylight. We’ll keep asking the annoying questions and digging for the real story so you don’t have to.</li>
<li><strong>A true global megaphone.</strong> A breakthrough in Zagreb deserves the same volume as one in Silicon Valley. By merging the TechCrunch and Foundry networks, we will amplify European innovation to millions more readers in 190+ countries, providing deeper insights and a truly unified global vision.</li>
</ul>
<p>To the startup community: Keep your tips, term sheets, and tantrums coming. Send them to tips@techcrunch.com or ping our encrypted channels. We’ll be listening — louder and more broadly than ever.</p>
<p>TechCrunch isn’t retreating from Europe. We’re doubling down.</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">Los Angeles-based Coco Robotics, a startup building last-mile delivery robots, announced it raised $80 million on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The funding round included angel investors Sam Altman and Max Altman, both returning investors, in addition to VC firms like Pelion Venture Partners and Offline Ventures, among others.</p>
<p>This brings the company’s total funding to more than $120 million. The company last raised a $36 million Series A round in 2021.</p>
<p>Coco’s zero-emissions robots can hold 90 liters’ worth of groceries or goods and have made more than 500,000 deliveries since they hit the streets in 2020, the company said. It says it works with national retailers, including Subway, Wingstop, and Jack in the Box.</p>
<p>Sam Altman’s financial interest in Coco is clear. While he’s personally providing capital to the company, OpenAI apparently gets a benefit too. Coco announced a partnership with OpenAI in March which allows Coco to use OpenAI while the AI company gains the real-world data the robots collect to train its models.</p>
<p>The company was founded in 2020 by Brad Squicciarini and Zach Rash.</p>
<p>TechCrunch reached out to Coco for more information.</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">At WWDC 2025 on Monday, Apple unveiled a series of new features that will launch with iOS 26 this fall across its apps. These include significant updates like Call Screening, more travel-friendly features in Wallet, and highly requested group chat features in Messages.</p>
<p>Some of these updates include Apple Intelligence, like Live Translation. Others, like Apple bringing back tabs in the Photos app, just make devices a bit easier to use. We’ll update this post as new features come out. </p>
<h2 id="h-phone"><strong>Phone</strong></h2>
<p>Call Screening lets you determine what a call is about before picking it up. When you get a call from an unknown number, Call Screening will automatically answer silently in the background. When the caller shares their name and the reason for their call, the iPhone will ring, and you can view their response before deciding whether to pick up or ignore it.</p>
<figure><img src="/Users/ajaymac/Desktop/raw project/DailyNews/DailyNews/techCrunch/images/Apple-WWDC25-iOS-26-Apple-Intelligence-Call-Screening-250609_inline.jpg.medium_2x.jpg"/><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Apple</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Hold Assist will detect hold music and stay on the line for you until a live agent is available, and Live Translation will translate conversations on the fly. Your words will be translated as you talk, and the translation is spoken out loud via an AI voice for the call recipient. As the person you’re speaking to responds in their own language, you’ll hear a spoken translation of their voice.</p>
<h2 id="h-messages"><strong>Messages</strong></h2>
<p>Members in group chats on Messages can now create polls to better plan events and make quick decisions. Apple Intelligence will also detect when a poll might be useful and suggest that users start one. Plus, group chats can now create custom backgrounds for chats and see typing indicators, and you can now request, send, and receive Apple Cash in group chats. </p>
<figure><img src="/Users/ajaymac/Desktop/raw project/DailyNews/DailyNews/techCrunch/images/Apple-WWDC25-iOS-26-Polls-in-Messages-250609_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg"/><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Apple</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The app now also lets you screen messages from unknown senders. Messages from unknown senders will appear in a dedicated folder where you can mark the number as known, ask for more information, or delete the message. Apple notes that these messages will remain silenced until a user accepts them. </p>
<p>Live Translation is also coming to Messages. The feature will automatically translate text for you as you type and deliver it in your preferred language. When the person you’re texting responds, their message will be translated for you. </p>
<h2 id="h-apple-music"><strong>Apple Music</strong></h2>
<p>Apple Music users will get access to a Lyrics Translation feature to help them understand the words in their favorite songs in other languages. A new Lyrics Pronunciation feature will display phonetic lyrics so that listeners can sing along in a different language. </p>
<figure><img src="/Users/ajaymac/Desktop/raw project/DailyNews/DailyNews/techCrunch/images/Apple-WWDC25-iOS-26-Music-Lyric-Translation-250609_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg"/><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Apple</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The app is also adding an AudioMix feature that will transition from one song to the next using time stretching and beat matching like a DJ to deliver continuous playback. The feature could be seen as a competitor to Spotify’s AI DJ feature.  </p>
<p>Apple is also introducing a karaoke feature that will turn your iPhone into a handheld microphone for Apple TV. The feature will amplify your voice as you belt your favorite songs, as real-time lyrics and visuals appear on the TV screen. </p>
<p>You can also pin your favorite music to the top of your Library in Apple Music to allow for easier access. </p>
<h2 id="h-apple-maps"><strong>Apple Maps</strong></h2>
<p>Apple Maps is going to get better at understanding your daily commute. It will now use on-device intelligence to start showing you preferred routes when headed home or to the office. The app will notify you of delays and offer alternative routes, too. </p>
<figure><img src="/Users/ajaymac/Desktop/raw project/DailyNews/DailyNews/techCrunch/images/Apple-WWDC25-iOS-26-Maps-Visited-Places_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg"/><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Apple</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Apple Maps is also getting a new Visited Places feature that will help you remember the places you’ve been. You can choose to have your iPhone detect when you’re at a restaurant or shop, and view all of your Visited Places in Maps. Apple notes that Visited Places are protected with end-to-end encryption and that it cannot access them. </p>
<h2 id="h-apple-wallet-nbsp"><strong>Apple Wallet </strong></h2>
<p>Apple Wallet is introducing the ability for people to store a digital version of their passport, called a Digital ID. The tech giant notes that this won’t be a replacement for your actual passport, but it can be used in apps that need to verify age and identity, and at supported TSA checkpoints. With Real ID implementation in effect, Digital ID will give you another way to present an ID in person during domestic travel. </p>
<figure><img src="/Users/ajaymac/Desktop/raw project/DailyNews/DailyNews/techCrunch/images/Apple-WWDC25-iOS-26-Apple-Wallet-Digital-ID_inline.jpg.medium_2x.jpg"/><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Apple</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In addition, another feature will let you present your driver’s license or state ID in Wallet to websites for age and identity verification, starting with Chime, Turo, Uber Eats, and U.S. Bank, as well as the Arizona MVD, Georgia DDS, and Maryland MVA.</p>
<p>Apple is also refreshing its boarding pass experience in Wallet. You’ll now get real-time updates about flights with Live Activities. You can also share your flight’s Live Activities with others so they can remain updated on your travels. </p>
<figure><img src="/Users/ajaymac/Desktop/raw project/DailyNews/DailyNews/techCrunch/images/Apple-WWDC25-iOS-26-Live-Activities-shareable-live-flight-status_inline.jpg.medium_2x.jpg"/><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Apple</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You’ll now be able to access Maps from your boarding pass in Wallet to navigate to the airport. You can also use Find My to track items and report lost baggage from the boarding pass, and also view key services on an airline’s app, such as seat upgrades and standby lists.</p>
<p>Apple also announced that Wallet now uses Apple Intelligence to automatically summarize and display order tracking details from emails sent from merchants or delivery carriers. </p>
<h2 id="h-facetime"><strong>FaceTime</strong></h2>
<p>Like Phone and Messages, FaceTime will leverage Live Translation to let people communicate with each other in different languages. When you’re talking to someone in a different language, FaceTime will display translated captions so that the two of you can understand each other. </p>
<figure><img src="/Users/ajaymac/Desktop/raw project/DailyNews/DailyNews/techCrunch/images/Apple-WWDC25-iOS-26-Apple-Intelligence-Live-Translation-FaceTime-250609_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg"/><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Apple</span></figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="h-photos">Photos</h2>
<p>After receiving significant user backlash for its Photos app redesign in iOS 18, Apple is bringing back a tabbed interface to Photos. In Collections, you’ll find your favorites, albums, and the ability to search across your library. The Library tab makes it easier to scroll through recent photos.</p>
<figure><img src="/Users/ajaymac/Desktop/raw project/DailyNews/DailyNews/techCrunch/images/photos-app-ios-26.jpeg"/><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Apple</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Photos app is also able to transform your 2D photos into 3D spatial photos.</p>
<h2 id="h-camera">Camera</h2>
<p>The iPhone’s Camera app will showcase the two capture modes you use most on the main screen: photo and video. To reveal additional modes, like Portrait Mode and Cinematic Mode, you can swipe your finger left or right. </p>
<figure><img src="/Users/ajaymac/Desktop/raw project/DailyNews/DailyNews/techCrunch/images/Screenshot-2025-06-10-at-2.12.32PM.png"/><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Apple</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To access other settings, such as flash, timer, aperture, and more, you’ll now swipe up from the bottom of the screen. You can also change formats with a tap, which can be helpful when switching between HD and 4K resolution or adjusting the frame rate on video.</p>
<h2 id="h-apple-podcasts"><strong>Apple Podcasts</strong></h2>
<p>Apple Podcasts is getting a new customized playback experience that will allow you to choose speed options, from 0.5x and 3x. The feature will bring listening experience on Apple Podcasts more in line with Spotify, which already lets you choose playback speed for podcasts.</p>
<figure><img src="/Users/ajaymac/Desktop/raw project/DailyNews/DailyNews/techCrunch/images/Apple-WWDC25-iOS-26-Apple-Podcasts-customized-listening-experience_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg"/><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Apple</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Plus, Apple Podcasts is getting an “Enhance Dialogue” feature that will use audio processing and machine learning to make speech more clear over background sounds.</p>
<h2 id="h-image-playground"><strong>Image Playground</strong></h2>
<figure><img src="/Users/ajaymac/Desktop/raw project/DailyNews/DailyNews/techCrunch/images/apple-image-playground.png"/><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Apple</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Apple is adding a ChatGPT integration to supercharge Image Playground. You’ll be able to access new styles, such as vector art or an oil painting. Plus, you’ll be able to tap the “Any Style” option to describe exactly what you want. Image Playground will send the description or photo to ChatGPT to create a unique image.</p>

<div>
<p id="speakable-summary">Geothermal frontrunner Fervo Energy said Wednesday that it had secured $206 million in financing to continue work on a new power plant in Utah. </p>
<p>The startup is developing what promises to be the largest enhanced geothermal power plant in the world. The initial phase of Cape Station is expected to come online next year and produce 100 megawatts of electricity, and a subsequent expansion set to open in 2028 will add another 400 megawatts.</p>
<p>Enhanced geothermal, which runs deeper and hotter than traditional geothermal, has become a favored technology in the quest to find new power sources for AI data centers. By tapping the Earth’s heat, geothermal promises to provide 24/7 power without emissions. It doesn’t hurt that it relies on skills pioneered by the oil and gas industry, something that likely helps its standing within the Trump administration.</p>
<p>The news comes the day after Fervo announced that it had completed its hottest and deepest well to date. The company said it drilled down 15,765 feet in 16 days, and the temperature at the bottom of the well is expected to stabilize at around 520°F.</p>
<p>Drilling time represents a large share of geothermal power plant costs, which is why startups have been racing to see who can drill deeper and faster.</p>
<p>Fervo’s results have unlocked a new spigot of cash. The financing announced today includes $100 million in project-level preferred equity from Breakthrough Energy Catalyst, the project finance arm of Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy group. Mercuria, which had previously provided a $120 million loan, provided another $60 million to that facility. And an X-Caliber Rural Capital affiliate contributed $45.6 million in bridge debt financing.</p>
<p>The startup has been on a fundraising tear lately. Fervo raised $244 million in February 2024 and another $255 million in December that was split between equity and debt. Energy secretary Chris Wright was at the helm of Liberty Energy when the company invested in Fervo in 2022.</p>
<p>The increasing amounts of debt are a sign that investors feel that enhanced geothermal has passed through the commercial valley of death and is ready for widespread commercial adoption.</p>

</div></div><h2>Can Scale AI and Alexandr Wang reignite Meta’s AI efforts?</h2><div class="page" id="readability-page-1"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">Meta is reportedly investing nearly $15 billion in the data-labeling firm Scale AI and taking a 49% stake in the startup, while also bringing on CEO Alexandr Wang to help lead a new “superintelligence” lab within the company.</p>
<p>The deal is reminiscent of Meta’s previous large and risky bets, such as its $19 billion acquisition of WhatsApp and its $1 billion Instagram purchase. At the time those mergers closed, many people suggested Meta had grossly overpaid for the platforms — and today’s discourse is no different. There’s no shortage of investors and founders who were left scratching their heads this weekend over Meta’s latest tie-up.</p>
<p>In the end, WhatsApp and Instagram became an integral part of CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s empire. The question is whether the Scale AI deal will similarly work in Meta’s favor, proving Zuckerberg’s prescient strategy yet again, or whether the company is grasping at straws in a misguided effort to catch up to rivals like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic.</p>
<p>In this case, Meta isn’t betting on an emerging social media app, but on the data used to train top AI models. For the last several years, leading AI labs such as OpenAI have relied on Scale AI to produce and label data that’s used to train models. In recent months, Scale AI and its data annotation competitors have started hiring highly skilled people, such as PhD scientists and senior software engineers, to generate high-quality data for frontier AI labs.</p>
<p>It may benefit Meta to have a close relationship with a data provider like Scale. Meta’s leaders have complained about a lack of innovation around data in the company’s leading AI teams, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Meta’s generative AI unit launched Llama 4, a family of AI models that failed to match the capabilities of Chinese AI lab DeepSeek’s models and that was broadly seen as a disappointment. Not helping matters, Meta is trying to combat an attrition problem. According to data compiled by SignalFire, Meta lost 4.3% of its top talent to AI labs in 2024.</p>
<p>Meta isn’t betting on only Scale AI to reignite its AI efforts, but also on Wang to lead the aforementioned new superintelligence team. The 28-year-old CEO has proven himself to be a strong startup founder — he’s known around Silicon Valley to be ambitious, a good salesman, and very well-connected. Over the past few months, Wang has been meeting with world leaders to discuss AI’s impact on society.</p>
<p>Wang hasn’t led an AI lab of this sort before, however, and he doesn’t have the same AI research background that many other AI lab leaders do, like Safe Superintelligence’s Ilya Sutskever or Mistral’s Arthur Mensch. That’s perhaps why Meta is also said to be recruiting high-profile talent like DeepMind’s Jack Rae to round out its new AI research group.</p>
<p>The post-acquisition fate of Scale AI the company is a bit murky. The role of real-world data in AI model training is changing — some AI labs have brought data collection efforts in-house, while others have increased their reliance on synthetic (i.e., AI-generated) data. In April, The Information reported that Scale AI had missed some of its revenue targets.</p>
<p>According to Anyscale co-founder Robert Nishihara, several frontier AI labs are exploring novel ways to leverage and optimize data, many of which are quite compute-intensive.</p>
<p>“Data is a moving target,” Nishihara told TechCrunch in an interview. “It’s not just a finite effort to catch up — you have to innovate.”</p>
<p>It’s possible that Meta and Wang’s relationship could scare off other AI labs that have traditionally worked with Scale AI. If so, this deal could be a boon for Scale AI’s competitors, such as Turing, Surge AI, and even nonconventional data providers such as the recently launched LM Arena. </p>
<p>Turing CEO Jonathan Siddharth told TechCrunch via email that he’s received increased interest from customers in light of the rumors around Meta’s deal with Scale AI.</p>
<p>“I think there will be some clients who will prefer to work with a partner that’s more neutral,” he said.</p>
<p>Only time will tell how Meta’s investment will pan out for its AI efforts, but the company has significant ground to make up. Meanwhile, the competition isn’t slowing down. OpenAI is gearing up for the release of its next flagship model, GPT-5, as well as its first openly available model in years — a model that’ll compete with Meta’s current and future Llama releases.</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">A U.S. government website designed to inform the public about vaccines has been defaced and now hosts apparently AI-generated spam.</p>
<p>The domain, which belongs to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), appears to have been hosting the same kind of content — mostly gay-themed and LGBTQ+ posts — since at least May 12, according to an archived version of the site.</p>
<p>It’s unclear who is responsible for it, or what is the purpose of this defacement other than pushing AI-generated slop spam. Websites hosted on official U.S. government domains have been hijacked in the past to host scam ads and hacking services.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, 404 Media reported that the vaccines HHS website is part of a wider spam operation that includes websites owned by NPR, Nvidia, and Stanford University, all of which redirect to “a nonsense SEO spam page,” as 404 Media journalist Sam Cole called it, hosted on wowlazy.com. </p>
<p>HHS did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.</p>
</div></div><h2>At WWDC, Apple says it will use AI to tag apps to improve discoverability on the App Store</h2><div class="page" id="readability-page-1"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">Apple will begin using AI technology to power the discovery of apps on the App Store, the company announced at this week’s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC 25).</p>
<p>In a session focused on updates to App Store Connect, its app distribution platform for developers, the company announced it will introduce App Store Tags — labels that highlight specific features and functionalities found in an app.</p>
<p>These tags will initially be generated by Apple’s large language models using various sources, like the app’s metadata. They’ll then be human-reviewed before being applied to apps on the App Store.</p>
<p>Apple customers will be able to use these tags when searching for apps on the App Store, where the tags appear alongside the categories on the search page and the apps that appear in the search results. </p>
<p>Apple says the new tags will help surface information that’s often buried in app listings, like the app’s App Store description, category, metadata, or even in its screenshots. The tags, Apple believes, will help users more easily find the apps that offer the functionality they’re looking for, while also giving developers a better idea about how their apps are being discovered.</p>
<p>Today, consumers find apps through a number of App Store features, including its editorial pieces on the Today tab, collections curated by the App Store’s editorial team, by browsing app categories, or using App Store Search. Apple also monetizes the App Store with ads that can appear on the Today tab, the Search tab, on product pages, and in its search results. </p>
<p>When App Store users tap on one of the new tags, they’ll be taken to a new page offering a curated collection of all the apps and games that offer similar features or functionality — an extension to the App Store’s existing feature that points users to apps they “might also like,” found at the bottom of individual listings. </p>
<p>Although the tags themselves are AI-generated and reviewed, developers will ultimately have the final word on which tags are associated with their apps. A new information page will be available in the App Store Connect software, where they can manage tags or deselect those they don’t want to show up on their app’s product page. </p>
<p>Apple is already using AI on its App Store to summarize an app’s reviews by combining information into a short paragraph.</p>
<p>Tags aren’t the only improvements coming to the App Store. Apple says that developers will also be able to create custom product pages that appear when a user searches for apps using particular keywords. It’s also improving its app “nutrition labels” feature; expanding its lineup of app age ranges (there are now five); and extending offer codes to consumables, non-consumables, and non-renewing subscriptions. </p>

<p id="speakable-summary">Khaby Lame, currently the world’s top TikTok creator, was recently detained by U.S. immigration officials in Las Vegas and has since left the country, The New York Times reports. According to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Lame, an Italian Senegalese influencer known for his silent, deadpan reactions to viral clips, overstayed the terms of his visa after arriving in April. He was reportedly granted voluntary departure and is now abroad.</p>
<p>The situation grabbed headlines after a teenage influencer, Bo Loudon, boasted on X that he flagged Lame’s immigration status to authorities. Loudon, who often posts political content, said he reached out to contacts to report it.</p>
<p>Lame, 25, has built a massive global following — and a string of lucrative brand deals — after he reportedly lost his job during the pandemic. In addition to partnering with big names like Hugo Boss, he has also appeared — very briefly — in a Hollywood movie and starred in a three-part travel series about his time in the U.S. He hasn’t publicly addressed the incident as of this writing.</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">Wikipedia has reportedly paused an experiment that used AI to summarize articles on its platform after editors pushed back.</p>
<p>Wikipedia announced earlier this month it was going to run the experiment for users who have the Wikipedia browser extension installed and chose to opt in, according to 404 Media. AI-generated summaries appeared at the top of every Wikipedia article with a yellow “unverified” label. Users had to click to expand and read them.</p>
<p>Editors almost immediately criticized the pilot, raising concerns that it could damage Wikipedia’s credibility. Often, the problem with AI-generated summaries is that they contain mistakes, the result of AI “hallucinations.” News publications running similar experiments, like Bloomberg, have been forced to issue corrections and, in some cases, scale back their tests.</p>
<p>While Wikipedia has paused its experiment, the platform has indicated it’s still interested in AI-generated summaries for use cases like expanding accessibility.</p>
