They sent shock waves just ahead of the second round of peace talks in Istanbul and NATO’s Eastern Flank summit in Vilnius.</p><p>As the Russia-Ukraine war is in its fourth year, with mounting human and economic costs and rising global pressure for a diplomatic resolution, an endgame is in place. The revival of the Istanbul peace process and renewed engagement by key international players have reoriented attention towards diplomacy. Yet major questions persist: Will Ukraine’s audacious strikes shift the war’s trajectory? Can Ukraine endure the prolonged conflict? And can the main actors — Ukraine, Russia, the U.S., NATO, and the European Union — overcome entrenched divisions to forge a durable peace?</p><h4 class="sub_head">The return of diplomacy</h4><p>As peace talks stalled under U.S. President Donald Trump, the Istanbul peace process was cautiously revived by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Two rounds of talks on May 16 and June 1 saw prisoner swaps and draft ceasefire terms exchanged. However, deep divisions remain, with both sides presenting largely irreconcilable conditions that hinder meaningful progress.</p><div data-ga-label="AlsoReadArticle"><div><div>
									How drones are the new face of warfare</div><div></div></div></div><p>Russia’s ‘Special Military Operation’ could have ended in Istanbul negotiations in 2022, but a possible peace deal failed as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy walked away from it. Ukraine chose to continue fighting as it hoped for NATO membership and Western leaders pledged funding, weapons, and training.</p><p>U.S. President Donald Trump, prioritising his ‘America First’ and ‘Make America Great Again’ agenda, views the Ukraine war as a complex foreign policy challenge and seeks a swift end to it. His envoy, Keith Kellogg, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio acknowledged it as a dangerous “proxy war between nuclear powers — the United States, helping Ukraine, and Russia”, and began Russia-Ukraine talks in February 2025. Mr. Trump sees no common ground or trust between Russia, Europe, and Ukraine, making an end to the Russia-NATO proxy war difficult. Acting as both participant and mediator, he believes a breakthrough is urgently needed.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s three months of shuttle diplomacy have sparked hope for peace. The peace framework addresses both sides’ concerns. Ukraine won’t join NATO, will gain security guarantees, accept a ceasefire, and territorial concessions. Sanctions on Russia will be lifted, and the present frontline will be frozen.</p><p>Ukraine-Europe peace terms include a permanent ceasefire, no limits on Ukraine’s military, and a U.S.-backed security guarantee akin to NATO’s Article 5. Sanctions would ease gradually after achieving lasting peace, while occupied territories remain unrecognised. European leaders’ ‘Coalition of the Willing’ meetings, led by the U.K. and France, seek a ‘reassurance force’ to monitor the peace accord’s implementation.</p><p>Russia demands addressing the war’s root causes, Ukrainian neutrality, NATO-membership ban, demilitarisation, denazification, and troop withdrawals. It also seeks ceasefire guarantees that Ukraine won’t regroup and receive Western munitions. If the West does not accept these terms, Mr. Putin warns of imposing terms militarily.</p><p>In February, Mr. Trump proposed to initiate denuclearisation talks with Russia and China, considering the Ukraine war’s potential for nuclear escalation and the expiry of the NEW START Treaty with Russia in 2026. Russian experts see this as a honey trap, reminiscent of former U.S. President Ronald Reagan’s trick with the Soviet Union’s President Mikhail Gorbachev. Kremlin remains sceptical of Western intentions and views Russia’s nuclear power as a necessary deterrent.</p><p>The broader Western posture is to continue supporting Ukraine until Russia is strategically defeated. In 2022, the European Parliament and the NATO Parliamentary Assembly designated Russia a ‘state sponsor of terrorism,’ complicating direct diplomatic engagement, while former U.S. President Joe Biden said ‘no’ to such a toxic ‘terrorist’ label for Russia.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s interest in ending the war is due to avoiding damage to America’s reputation. He wants to deal with China and engage in the West Asian and Indo-Pacific region. The Ukraine war tests Europe’s global autonomy, but its Russophobic stance hampers dialogue by framing Russia as an existential threat and exposing racism and militarisation.</p><p>The West is waging a proxy war in Ukraine and, as is the case with any proxy in history, Ukraine’s agency to decide the course of war is limited. Escalation risks are rising as Ukrainian drones allegedly targeted Mr. Putin’s convoy in Kursk on May 20, 2025. Earlier incidents included bridge bombings in Kursk, drone attacks near Moscow, and a threat to the Victory Day parade. In response, Russia has escalated its military campaign, aiming to create a ‘security buffer zone’ along the Ukraine border. Mr. Putin warned that rejecting current peace terms would make any future peace “more painful.”</p><h4 class="sub_head">A fragile endgame</h4><p>Ukraine’s deep strikes into Russia, likely aided by Western intelligence, risk escalation. Under its nuclear doctrine, Russia may retaliate if sovereignty is threatened. Operation Spiderweb escalates Russia’s ‘Special Military Operation’ into a full-scale war. Though humiliated, Russia’s engagement in peace talks signals a real interest in ending the conflict. In such a scenario,</p><p><b><i>K.B.

The difficult task of keeping everyone happy
<div><span>Premium</span></div></h1><h2 class="sub-title">The Congress’s commitment to social justice comes with challenges</h2><div><div><!--[if IE 9]><video style="display: none;"><![endif]--><img src="/Users/ajaymac/Desktop/raw project/DailyNews/DailyNews/images/Telangana.jpg"/><!--[if IE 9]></video><![endif]--></div></div><div id="content-body-69679496" itemprop="articleBody"><p><span class="drop-caps">T</span>he recent Cabinet expansion in Telangana reflects the Congress’s promised commitment to social justice. By inducting three Ministers — Gaddam Vivek and Adluri Laxman from the Scheduled Caste (SC) group and Vakiti Srihari from the Backward Classes (BC) group — as well as leaders from socially and economically backward communities for various posts, the party has attempted to realign its power structure to better represent historically marginalised groups. However, this has not come without friction, particularly from the dominant Reddy community, which feels ignored despite its numerical and political clout in the Assembly.</p><p>Of the seven BC MLAs in the Congress, three have been given Cabinet posts and two have been appointed as chief whip and whip. Among Ministers, Ponnam Prabhakar is from the Goud community, Konda Surekha belongs to the Padmashali community (with her husband hailing from the Munnuru Kapu community), and Vakiti Srihari comes from the Mudiraj caste. Pradesh Congress Committee chief A. Mahesh Kumar Goud is a Goud from the BC community. BCs enjoy more representation not just in the Cabinet, but also in key political roles.</p><p>Additionally, with the inclusion of Mr. Vivek and Mr. Laxman, the number of SC leaders in the Cabinet has increased to four. They are split equally between the Mala and Madiga sub-groups. This balance is critical in a State where internal divisions within SC communities have influenced political equations, particularly the Madiga Reservation Porata Samiti. Deputy Chief Minister Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka, a Mala, holds the Finance portfolio, while former Deputy Chief Minister Damodar Raja Narsimha holds the Health portfolio.</p><p>Despite this progressive outlook, Congress has triggered dissatisfaction within its largest and historically most influential support base, the Reddy community. In the 119-member Assembly, 43 MLAs are from the Reddy community. Within the Congress, 26 of the 64 MLAs are from the Reddy community.</p><p>Those who have been left out include strong aspirants such as Komatireddy Rajgopal Reddy, P. Sudarshan Reddy, T. Rammohan Reddy, and Malreddy Ranga Reddy.</p><p>Mr. Rajgopal Reddy, who played a key role in boosting the Congress’s prospects by jumping ship from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) before the elections, feels particularly aggrieved, especially since his political ally, Vivek Venkatswamy, was inducted into the Cabinet. Both leaders were promised a berth. When Mr. Rajgopal Reddy, Mr. Venkatswamy, and Ponguleti Srinivas Reddy from the Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) entered the Congress at around the same time, it created the perception that the BJP was losing ground and that the Congress was the only alternative to the BRS.</p><p>No one can deny impact of these leaders on the overall performance of the party even though Revanth Reddy, who was then PCC chief, strongly built an anti-BRS narrative. The BJP, which was looking strong, lost steam when Mr. Rajgopal Reddy and Mr. Venkatswamy exited the party at a crucial juncture. Mr. Rajgopal Reddy’s brother, Komatireddy Venkata Reddy, is a Minister and hails from Nalgonda — a Reddy bastion. While being progressive in its politics, the Congress would also do well in ensuring that its traditional support base, the Reddy community, is kept happy.</p><p>While the Congress’s caste arithmetic may have worked, the representation of regional and minority members leaves much to be desired. Key districts such as Hyderabad, Ranga Reddy, and Nizamabad have gone not represented in the Cabinet. Muslims, and Lambadas among the tribal communities, have also been left out.</p><p>There is no Muslim MLA in the Congress fold. The party has only one Muslim MLC, Amer Ali Khan. To bridge this gap, Congress is considering fielding a Muslim candidate from Jubilee Hills in the coming by-election. The names of Mohd Azharuddin, a cricketer, and Faheem Qureshi, a confidante of the Chief Minister, are being floated.</p><p>To compensate for the absence of the Lambada community, the Chief Minister nominated Ram Chander Naik, an MLA from Dornakal, as Deputy Speaker. This complements the appointment of Gaddam Prasad Kumar, a Dalit, as Speaker. As a result, Telangana is perhaps the only State where both the presiding officers of the Assembly belong to the SC and ST communities, respectively.</p><div id="arthardpv"></div><div></div><div><div id="artproduct2"></div></div><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/Hindu_Desktop_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/Hindu_Desktop_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid05, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid05, publisher: The Hindu --></div><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Mweb_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Mweb_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle05, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle05, publisher: The Hindu --></div></div></div><div class="col-xl-9 col-lg-8 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-12 editorial" data-id="69679209" data-title="​Maximum Mumbai: On the city, its transportation needs  " data-url="https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/maximum-mumbai-the-city-its-transportation-needs/article69679209.ece"><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --></div><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --></div><h1 class="title" itemprop="name">
​Maximum Mumbai: On the city, its transportation needs  
</h1><h2 class="sub-title">The city needs long term solutions to its transportation needs</h2><div id="content-body-69679209" itemprop="articleBody"><p>The railways have proposed automatic sliding doors with ventilation louvres in all Mumbai suburban trains by next year in response to the Mumbra train tragedy on Monday (June 9, 2025) — four people died and nearly a dozen others were injured. Sliding doors could potentially force people inside and prevent footboard travel, a factor in the accident. They could ensure that passengers do not get down at unscheduled stops and put themselves in danger of being mowed down by passing trains. The proposed vestibules connecting the coaches may also help to evenly distribute the crowds. As in Japan, each station may then need a few enforcers who could shove the crowds in so that the doors could shut and the trains move. While footboard travel is indeed a dangerous safety issue, it is only an outcome of the dangerous overcrowding in Mumbai trains. For vast numbers of people, the trains offer the least expensive travel option. Not too long ago, the dangers of overcrowding resulted in the infamous stampede at the Elphinstone Road station bridge in 2017. Multiple deaths are common along the three arteries that are the lifelines of Mumbai – the Central, Harbour and Western railway lines. Many are hit by trains while crossing tracks instead of using roads or bridges. While rail safety is an immediate issue that needs to be addressed, it is also time city leaders engineer inexpensive, alternative travel options to the trains.</p><p>Mumbai’s trains have been seen as an inevitable part of the extreme urbanisation that the city represents and romanticised by literature. But they are simply not humane modes of transport. The suburban train system has undergone little change over the decades though the city has boosted its roads and enabled more vehicular traffic. Two-wheelers that were a rarity a few decades ago are now common. While the Metro promises to decongest the city to an extent, these services price out the lower classes. Bus services could be enhanced for routes connecting shorter distances. Along with doubling efforts to change the structuring of the city from a north-south network with commuter movements dictated by times, planners should consider expanding ferry transport — a cheaper and possibly more eco-friendly mode of transport to a city bound by the sea. Broadly speaking though, stampedes such as the one in Bengaluru, fire accidents in congested areas, and train tragedies such as the Mumbai one only highlight how unprepared India is to handle the consequences of urbanisation and the thrust to overturn the engagement of the vast majority of the people with agriculture.</p><div data-fragment-url="https://www.thehindu.com/fragment/getregionallist/69679209" id="reginallist"></div><div id="arthardpv"></div><div></div><div><div id="artproduct2"></div></div><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/Hindu_Desktop_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/Hindu_Desktop_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid05, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid05, publisher: The Hindu --></div><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Mweb_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Mweb_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle05, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle05, publisher: The Hindu --></div></div></div><div class="col-xl-9 col-lg-8 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-12 opinion" data-id="69679782" data-title="The hazards of going global on India-Pakistan issues" data-url="https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/the-hazards-of-going-global-on-india-pakistan-issues/article69679782.ece"><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --></div><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --></div><h1 class="title" itemprop="name">

An entangled web of frozen ideas has enveloped the situation making it impossible to separate the different strands. The developments following the Second World War and the evolution of the Cold War have also impacted heavily on the situation. Thus, any initiative, however sincere and logical it may be, will be hampered by the existing literature formulated by the United Nations and other international bodies, not to speak of Pakistan’s stubborn position that Kashmir is the core issue. It is for this reason that Pakistan finds the smokescreen of resolutions and concepts relating to Jammu and Kashmir (J&amp;K), terrorism, self-determination, non-proliferation and peaceful settlement of disputes spread over the last 70 years or more.</p><p>For instance, in the briefing given to India’s seven teams of special envoys sent out to various countries after Operation Sindoor, the very first point they were asked to assert was that J&amp;K is an integral part of India. Most countries, particularly those which do not follow developments closely, would look up the literature and the UN maps and find that there is an inscription on UN maps depicting the India-Pakistan border, particularly in the region of J&amp;K. The inscription says, “Dotted line represents approximately the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir agreed upon by India and Pakistan. The final status of Jammu and Kashmir has not yet been agreed upon by the parties.” Sometimes, there is a more general disclaimer regarding boundaries on the map such as: “the boundaries and names shown and the designations used on this map do not imply official endorsement or acceptance by the United Nations.” Therefore, most countries would not make a commitment on the question of borders. At best, they would tell us that a bilateral solution, as envisaged in the Simla Agreement, would be desirable.</p><h4 class="sub_head">India’s stand on terror</h4><p>Equally complex is India’s position on terrorism. More than 30 years ago, India introduced in the UN General Assembly, a draft for a Comprehensive Convention against Terrorism, which was dismissed as an anti-Pakistan move in which others were not interested. A one man department against terrorism in Vienna was nothing more than a research post. It did not even define terrorism because of the dictum that one man’s terrorist is another man’s freedom fighter. The support that India had given to fighters in Africa and Sri Lanka was pointed out as an example of the difficulty in defining terrorism. The only thing that the UN could do was to keep the definition of terrorism as vague as possible.</p><p>The shocking events of 9/11 (2001) brought terrorism, which was considered to be confined to West Asia and South Asia, centre stage in the United States and Europe and it appeared that decisive action would be taken to deal with the menace globally. But after hectic activity in the political and legal bodies of the UN to finalise binding laws, the focus shifted to U.S. military action in Afghanistan, which resulted in the ouster of the Taliban government. The war in Afghanistan was meant to root out terrorism, but after decades of conflict, the U.S. fled the country, leaving the Taliban in power.</p><h4 class="sub_head">The UN’s approach</h4><p>The UN Security Council has established several mechanisms to combat international terrorism, that are primarily centred around the various resolutions. Under these all member-states are obliged to take various economic and security measures to prevent the commission of terrorist acts. The Counter-Terrorism Committee of the Security Council was authorised to monitor the implementation of the overall plan. As for action against terrorists, this can be covered under Article 51 of the UN Charter, which recognises the inherent right of self defence if an armed attack occurs against a member-state. Though the application of this right in the case of terrorist attacks is complicated, it can provide a basis for a state to take action against terrorist groups that have attacked it. India’s position about surgical strikes on terrorist infrastructure will be judged as to whether such action is proportionate and in accordance with international humanitarian law.</p><p>The Security Council’s approach to counter-terrorism recognises that it requires a comprehensive “whole-of-society” approach that respects human rights and the rule of law. It emphasises international cooperation, the importance of addressing the conditions conducive to terrorism, and the need to prevent and counter violent extremism. In these circumstances, it will be hard for India to get a clear endorsement of its actions against terrorism. India does bring up terrorist attacks to the Security Council, but the Counter Terrorism Committee has not taken a clear position on the right of nations to treat a terrorist attack as an act of war — the new doctrine advanced by India.</p><p>The ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) and India’s restraint in crossing the LoC even in conflict situations are the other factors which are likely to come into play in any discussion in the Security Council or other international fora on India’s strategic strikes. India’s special envoys may have faced these questions in discussions even with friendly countries.</p><h4 class="sub_head">The issue of hyphenation</h4><p>When India took the issue of Pakistan’s invasion of Kashmir to the UN, it was a pure case of aggression which should have been considered under Chapter VII of the Charter. But as it happened , the issue was discussed under Article VI on Pacific Settlement of Disputes. Consequently, several extraneous ideas were incorporated in the agenda. leading to western countries hyphenating India and Pakistan on every issue. When Pakistan and India acquired nuclear weapons, Kashmir was considered a nuclear hot spot. India has a non-first use doctrine, while Pakistan threatens to multiply its conventional military capability.</p><p>India has an established position that any bilateral discussion would only be on terrorism and the status of Pakistan Occupied Kashmir. Therefore, diplomacy at the bilateral level or multilateral level is unlikely to be effective. Pakistan will continue to internationalise the Kashmir issue, but India should refrain from seeking international intervention or support. The reports of the special envoys will indicate, if anything, that such efforts are futile, given the history of the evolution of “the India-Pakistan question” in the Security Council.</p><p>India has nothing to gain by raising its concerns internationally as its narrative has got entangled in several controversial concepts in the UN. India’s only option is to ensure its security by appropriate military action as long as Pakistan continues its policy of inflicting a thousand cuts on India to gain Indian territory.</p><p><b><i>T.P.

​Polarised Poland: On politics, the Presidential election results  
</h1><h2 class="sub-title">Pro-Europe liberals and populist conservatives are at war</h2><div id="content-body-69679044" itemprop="articleBody"><p>When Donald Tusk’s diverse coalition came to power in Poland in 2023, ending the eight-year rule of the right-wing Law and Justice Party (PiS), the veteran centrist promised “to chase away the darkness”. Two years on, with the Tusk government still struggling to deliver on key reforms, Polish voters have elected a conservative backed by PiS as the country’s next President. Karol Nawrocki, a 42-year-old historian and former boxer with little political experience, won the June 1 presidential run-off with 50.89% votes, narrowly defeating the liberal Mayor of Warsaw, Rafal Trzaskowski, who secured 49.11%. Mr. Nawrocki, endorsed by Donald Trump and his MAGA movement, presented himself as an outsider populist, and promised a ‘Poland first’ approach that echoed Trumpian rhetoric. During its rule (2015–23), the PiS had implemented sweeping reforms that were aimed at tightening its control over state institutions and media, and recasting the Polish society along its ideological lines. It curbed abortion rights, overhauled education and filled the judiciary with party loyalists, often clashing with the European Union. Mr. Tusk attempted to roll back some of these measures, but met with strong opposition from the outgoing President, Andrzej Duda, also a PiS ally. As legislative logjam derailed Mr. Tusk’s reform agenda, Mr. Nawrocki capitalised on public resentment, attacking the Polish establishment and Brussels.</p><p>While Poland’s presidency is largely ceremonial, Mr. Nawrocki’s victory could significantly impact its politics. First, the President can veto laws passed by Parliament or send them to the constitutional court, now packed with judges appointed by the PiS government. In a post-election rally, Mr. Nawrocki said the Tusk government was trying to achieve a “monopoly” of power and vowed to prevent it, in a sign of what is to come. As the government does not have the three-fifths majority in Parliament to override presidential vetoes, Mr. Tusk could face further gridlock. Second, Mr. Nawrocki’s victory is a morale boost for Poland’s Eurosceptic right and may strengthen the alliance between the populist movements across the Atlantic. Despite his campaign rhetoric to oppose Ukraine joining NATO, he is unlikely to change Poland’s foreign policy core — be it its political and security alliance with the West or its opposition to Russia. But on social and economic policies, he is likely to follow the PiS’s right-wing conservatism. Third, the election result could exacerbate internal tensions within Mr. Tusk’s ideologically broad coalition which threaten to reduce Mr. Tusk to being a lame duck Prime Minister. All this points to a turbulent phase for Poland, where a politically polarised and socially divided nation braces for a prolonged tug of war between the pro-European centrists and ascendant populist conservatives.</p><div data-fragment-url="https://www.thehindu.com/fragment/getregionallist/69679044" id="reginallist"></div><div id="arthardpv"></div><div></div><div><div id="artproduct2"></div></div><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/Hindu_Desktop_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/Hindu_Desktop_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid05, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid05, publisher: The Hindu --></div><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Mweb_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Mweb_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle05, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle05, publisher: The Hindu --></div></div></div><div class="col-xl-9 col-lg-8 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-12 opinion" data-id="69679814" data-title="India’s legal bridge is one of reciprocity, not roadblocks" data-url="https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/indias-legal-bridge-is-one-of-reciprocity-not-roadblocks/article69679814.ece"><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --></div><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --></div><h1 class="title" itemprop="name">

                                      </p></div><div id="content-body-69679814" itemprop="articleBody"><p>In May this year, the Bar Council of India (BCI) implemented the Bar Council of India Rules for Registration and Regulation of Foreign Lawyers and Foreign Law Firms in India (hereinafter ‘rules’). While many within the legal profession lauded the rules, a few law firms based in the United States have voiced strong objections, calling the rules a “non-trade barrier” and a “deliberate move to exclude or freeze out” U.S. law firms from engaging with the Indian legal ecosystem.</p><p>However, such criticism reflects a limited appreciation of the statutory mandate of the BCI and an inadequate understanding of India’s comprehensive regulatory framework governing its legal affairs. On the contrary, the rules strike a balance by facilitating the entry of foreign practitioners and firms while upholding professional standards and safeguarding the interests of stakeholders within the Indian legal profession.</p><h4 class="sub_head">The criticism</h4><p>First, it is contended that the rules create a ‘non-tariff trade barrier’ by imposing procedural restrictions on U.S.-based law firms and legal professionals, thereby attempting to ‘freeze out’ their entry into the Indian legal landscape. Second, it is alleged that the interests of the U.S. were overlooked during global consultations preceding the framing of the rules, making it difficult for U.S. law firms and professionals to comply with the stipulated mandates. Third, the requirement to disclose details such as the ‘nature of legal work’ and ‘client identity’ is said to conflict with the American Bar Association (ABA) Model Rules on client confidentiality. Fourth, the regulations governing fly-in, fly-out provisions have been criticised for being inconsistent with the principle of reciprocity, as they impose duration-based, disclosure-based restrictions not similarly applied to Indian counterparts operating in the U.S. Fifth, the contention is that the rules have been introduced as a surprise move, providing no transition period for adjustment, thereby placing U.S. firms and professionals at a disadvantage. Finally, it is argued that the rules could adversely impact U.S.-India bilateral trade and legal engagement, as they may discourage Indian corporations from undertaking transactions involving U.S. laws, owing to a dearth of legal professionals who are skilled in U.S. laws.</p><h4 class="sub_head">A reality check</h4><p>First, the BCI is not a trade body, but a statutory body to maintain standards of professional conduct and safeguard the interests of legal professionals across India. Second, constitutionally and technically, the practice of law cannot form part of a trade agreement, as it is governed under Entries 77 and 78 of the Union List, unlike entries dealing with trade and commerce under the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India. Second, In Bar of Indian Lawyers Through Its President Jasbir Singh Malik vs D.K. Gandhi (2024), it was held that it was a contract of personal service, thereby segregating it from trade and business practices. Third, India recently chose not to include legal services in the United Kingdom-India Free Trade Agreement, despite facing significant international pressure. This reflects India’s consistent position that legal services require a distinct regulatory framework.</p><p>Fourth, the impugned rules do not bar foreign law firms and practitioners but liberalise the Indian legal ecosystem, albeit in a structured and regulated manner. For instance, Rules 3 and 4 permit foreign law firms to operate in India, subject to registration and compliance with ethical and professional conditions. Further, the fly-in, fly-out model, under the proviso to rule 3(1), allows temporary visits, subject to an aggregate stay not exceeding 60 days within a 12-month period. Fifth, Indian legal professionals lack universal access to the U.S. legal system and are subjected to rigorous, state-specific, examination-based licensing regimes. The reciprocity requirement under the rules, subjecting the U.S. counterparts to similar regulatory compliances, merely establishes equivalence. Sixth, rule 4(h), which mandates a certificate of ‘good standing at the bar’, has been flagged by U.S. stakeholders as problematic, owing to its decentralised ecosystem. However, this limitation stems from the U.S. regulatory structure and cannot be attributed to the BCI or India.</p><p>Notably, rule 6 of chapter III allows for flexibility, empowering the BCI to verify such credentials holistically and on a case-by-case basis, thereby ensuring an accommodating approach, subject to an adherence to basic ethical and professional standards. Seventh, the requirement to disclose the nature and the extent of legal work does not dilute client confidentiality, as the objective is to obtain general information about the legal work or transaction. This ensures that the activities of foreign legal professionals remain within the permitted contours of legal practice in India.</p><h4 class="sub_head">There has been debate and discussion</h4><p>Finally, the criticism regarding lack of consultations or a transition period before the operationalisation of the rules holds no ground. Debates and discussion have been ongoing for over two decades, encompassing expert committee reports, global consultations, and key judicial decisions such as Lawyers Collective vs Bar Council of India (2009) and Bar Council of India vs A.K. Balaji (2018) which have collectively laid the foundation for the present regulatory framework.</p><p>Far from being a barrier, the rules aim to create a cooperative bridge liberalising the Indian legal landscape in a measured manner, while safeguarding professional integrity, client confidentiality, and upholding the vital principles of reciprocity and ethical accountability.</p><p><b><i>Shivang Tripathi is a Senior Research Fellow at the Faculty of Law, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi.

                                      </p></div><div id="content-body-69678507" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Under the aegis of the National Education Policy (NEP), higher education in India is undergoing a not-so-silent makeover. The gap between the language of the policy and the language of implementation is a curious case in itself. On paper, the NEP champions interdisciplinarity, flexibility, and employability, appealing terms that resonate with global trends in 21st-century learning. But beneath this progressive surface lies a quiet but concerning transformation. Peel back the glossy brochure of 21st-century learning models and you can see the deeper shift: knowledge is being rebranded as content, students as clients, and professors as PR managers with PhDs. </p><p>This is not an isolated Indian phenomenon. It mirrors global neoliberal shifts in education, where accountability frameworks, performance indicators, and employability metrics have supplanted older ideals of intellectual growth and moral inquiry. While it is positive in many ways compared to previous models, there are many pertinent issues at stake. </p><p>By and large, the NEP reduces learning to feedback forms and grade or ranking inflation, neglecting the discomfort, struggle, and growth that any true education or learning experience demands. In such a set-up, the emotional labour of learning and teaching is often invisible, and care, once central to pedagogical ethics, becomes conditional, performative, and ultimately disposable. </p><h4 class="sub_head">Infantilisation of the learner in the name of compassion</h4><p>Gone is the intellectual messiness. In its place? Smiles, satisfaction surveys, and syllabi stripped of all sharp edges. Welcome to the age of the student-as-customer and the professor-as-service provider. </p><p>Please rate your classroom experience out of five stars. Forget rigorous inquiry! What we are getting is TEDx vibes, where the classroom becomes a performance stage. The teacher, a facilitator of good vibes. And the curriculum? A catalogue curated to avoid friction with dominant ideological comfort zones. Step into many universities today, and you will find a new decorum: slick, sanitised, and suspiciously soothing. </p><p>This customer-service approach does not empower students; it diminishes them. It flattens the rich, messy, and often contradictory nature of adult learning, also known as andragogy, into bite-sized, easily consumable pieces. Education is no longer about transformation. It is about satisfaction. Instead of creating a real-world engagement and understanding, the priority of today’s classroom is often to collect data, test scores, feedback ratings, and student numbers. Students are expected to absorb content quickly and feel good about it. </p><p>The professor who challenges the existing status quo? Too “negative”. The one who coaxes students through moral dilemmas and historical injustices? Too “intense”. The one who smiles, nods, and soothes everyone’s nerves? Promotion material. Therefore, better stick to dopamine-delivering videos and easily digestible content, lest we cause emotional distress to adult learners. </p><p>The point is not that mental health does not matter (it absolutely does), but there is a difference between care and coddling. Take the example of a student who found an assigned reading “anxiety-inducing.” The response? Remove the text. Modify the syllabus. Minimise discomfort.</p><p>But real learning is not always about keeping the learners comfortable. Sometimes, the learning process is slow, messy, and challenging. </p><p>The change in the learning environment is a historical process, too. During the Enlightenment in Europe, the focus shifted to knowledge based on reason, science, and logic. Apparently, this brought many benefits - technology, medicine, progress - but at the cost of instrumentalising human life, treating knowledge more like something to use than something to live by. </p><p>The rise of the scientific method, instrumental reason, and the resultant industrial capitalism reoriented knowledge toward control, prediction, and productivity. By the 20th century, this changed even more. With the rise of computers, the internet, and mass communication, we started thinking in terms of information: bits, bytes, messages. And now, in the 21st century, we have gone one step further. We live in a world driven by data: numbers, statistics, clicks, and algorithms. We want fast answers, predictions, and performance. What is celebrated here is a smart society with the smartphone revolution. </p><h4 class="sub_head">The cult of niceness</h4><p>Nice. Pleasant. Approachable. These are now the gold standards for educators — not insight, not rigour, not moral courage. Classrooms are conceived as therapy sessions. But the point is that supporting student well-being does not necessarily mean abandoning academic rigour altogether. </p><p>Diverse backgrounds and needs of the learner matter. The idea is not to ignore the diverse needs of the learners. That is where trauma-informed teaching becomes significant. But what we are witnessing as the outcome of the NEP model is something different: the manipulation of needs to the demand for a stagnant comfort zone and the pathologising of effort itself. While learners’ autonomy matters, academic tasks should not be confused with emotional harm. It is important to make learners believe that they are capable of facing the world’s intellectual and moral difficulties, not just their own emotions.</p><p>Take this real-life example: A professor asks students to read some materials. A student complains: “This kind of dense critical writing makes me anxious.” Instead of opening a conversation about discomfort as part of growth, the institution urges the professor to revise the syllabus. Less confrontation, more comfort. Professors are advised to avoid “heavy” topics. Course content is “curated” for maximum comfort. The classroom space is increasingly being treated as a wellness lounge.</p><p>Under the NEP’s data-driven metrics and performance audits, care is reduced to optics. Students are not asked to think, only to feel good. Assignments are now “triggering”. Reading is “stressful”. This is not a question of being a compassionate teacher. It’s about infantilising the learner. This ideology of infantilising the learner is not an accidental phenomenon. The worst hit is the humanities, long held to be the conscience of the academy, which is being asked to justify itself in the language of numbers. Research must be “measurable”, impact must be “visible”, and thinking must be “productive”.</p><h4 class="sub_head">The overpsychologisation of learning and the erosion of andragogy</h4><p>Even in classrooms where the humanities and liberal arts are the focus, a disturbing trend has taken hold — the overpsychologisation of learning. The language of therapy has replaced the language of inquiry in classrooms. Lengthy readings are “overwhelming”. Assignments are “too stressful.” Critical thinking is “too much.” This is not adult learning (andragogy). This is emotional event management. </p><p>The very concept of adult intellectual autonomy, central to higher education, is under threat. Andragogy, the philosophy of adult learning based on autonomy, critical engagement, and the integration of lived experience, withers away in such a fragile environment. Care ethics, too, suffers. Once a cornerstone of meaningful education, rooted in responsiveness and responsibility, care is now instrumentalised: reduced to keeping students satisfied rather than helping them grapple with the moral and ethical ambiguities of the real world.</p><p>Real care, the kind Nel Noddings talks about, is not the same as customer service. It’s not saying “yes” to everything, or making sure everyone leaves happy. It’s holding the learners accountable. It’s saying: I believe in your potential enough to challenge you.</p><p>Care ethics, as developed by thinkers like Nel Noddings, calls for a relational, responsive, and context-sensitive engagement with students. It insists that education is not merely about outcomes, but about nurturing the person, fostering critical thought, and supporting the learner’s moral and intellectual development. Yet, within the customer model, care is instrumentalised: empathy becomes a means to better ratings, and dialogue is reduced to diplomacy.</p><p>The trickiest aspect of this shift is its quantification. Under the NEP’s “measurable impact” model, every element of education must be counted, tracked, and assessed. Research must be output-driven. Learning outcomes must be visible and monetizable. Pedagogical success must be feedback-certified. This trend reflects a deeper shift in the educational imagination. Learning is no longer framed as a broader struggle, as engagement with something larger than the self, but as an emotional event that must be carefully curated to avoid inner disturbance. </p><h4 class="sub_head">Challenging the new status quo</h4><p>The NEP model is programmed to produce emotionally affirmed customers instead of intelligent learners. To resist this is not to be cruel. It is to take students seriously. It is to believe they are capable of facing the world’s intellectual and moral difficulties, not just their own emotions. It is to reclaim the classroom as a space not of avoidance, but of transformation. It is to fight for a model of education that honours the learner, not the customer; that cultivates understanding, not just consumption. It’s about resisting the soft tyranny of customer satisfaction forms and standing up for difficult conversations, slow reading, critical thinking, and moral inquiry.</p><p>For students: You deserve more than just pleasing classrooms and comfort zones. You deserve challenge, contradiction, artistic encounters and the dignity of struggle, one that brings out the best versions of your potential. For professors: Your role cannot be reduced to classroom therapists or a PR agent well-tuned to the demands of corporate psychology. You have got much difficult task in these challenging times. Let us not surrender thoughtful rigour for ratings. For administrators: If we sanitise classrooms of discomfort, we do not produce adult learners or resilient citizens -we churn out fragile consumers. </p><p>To rescue and relive the idea of the university, which has become a data-generation site, is a collective responsibility. The classroom is also a vibrant space for asking difficult questions about human meaning, morality, and collective futures, as it is now governed by dashboards, learning outcomes, and data-pooling and analytics. Where knowledge has been flattened into metrics, learning is just a performance. And the student is trained not to think, but to respond as a node in a feedback system. This is not simply a change in method; it is a change in what kind of humans our education system is designed to produce. If we give up everything for the data to decide, and if we do not push back now, loudly, messily, courageously, we are going to miss the classroom not just as a place of learning, but as a space of deeper questions of democracy.</p><p><i>(Dr. Sudeesh K serves as an Assistant Professor in the Department of English and Cultural Studies at CHRIST (Deemed to be University), Yeshwanthpur Campus, Bangalore.
