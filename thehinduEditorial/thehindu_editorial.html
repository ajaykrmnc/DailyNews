                                      </p></div><div id="content-body-69687316" itemprop="articleBody"><p><span>T</span>here was victory in the air in Bengaluru on June 4. After a 17-year-long wait, the city’s favourite franchise, Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB), had clinched the trophy in the Indian Premier League (IPL) the previous night. The team was landing in Bengaluru from Ahmedabad, and a victory parade was being planned. For a city reporter, this meant a long day.</p><p>At around 10 a.m., the reporting team got on a conference call to plan the stories. We discussed how the city had not slept after the victory, how fans from the city had travelled to Ahmedabad to watch the final match, and how people on the Internet had created a thousand different memes and reels.
</p><p>We also discussed threadbare how we would cover the proposed victory parade. We anticipated that the Central Business District (CBD), where our office is located, would be choked with vehicles from the afternoon as the victory parade was scheduled to begin after 3 p.m.
</p><p>While loyal newspaper readers may be willing to wait for more than a day to read about the celebrations that unfolded that night in Bengaluru, online readers move on to other websites if the stories they are looking for are not uploaded on time. So, before leaving for office that morning, I filed some stories on the fan frenzy, describing how firecrackers had kept the skies aglow the previous night, people had danced madly on the streets, and bike rallies had kept everyone awake.
</p><div data-ga-label="AlsoReadArticle"><p><img src="/Users/ajaymac/Desktop/raw project/DailyNews/DailyNews/images/PTI06_04_2025_000463A.jpg"/></p></div><p>My plan was simple: get to office early, file the special stories for the day, and keep the evening free as a great deal of coordination was necessary for covering such a mammoth event. An army of interns was stationed at multiple points at the city to watch the parade pass by.
</p><p>By around 1 p.m., fans clad in RCB colours begin to gather in CBD. I noted it down to draw a timeline later in the day. By 3 p.m., I finished filing three stories on the celebrations for online.
</p><p>But shortly, the unexpected happened. As lakhs of fans gathered around the M. Chinnaswamy stadium and Vidhana Soudha, we first got the news that a woman had lost consciousness. Then, more bad news trickled in: a person had died due to a “stampede-like situation”. My colleague immediately checked with her hospital sources and found that at least four people had died. Within an hour, seeing the raucous crowd, we knew that the numbers would climb into double-digits. It did not take too long for us to find out that 11 people had died, and most of them very young.
</p><p>The mood quickly shifted in the newsroom, just as it did in the rest of the city. We decided that the stories of celebrations would no longer be reported for the print edition. I frantically called the interns one after another to make sure they were safe, and asked them to come back to office. All the reporters in the newsroom breathed a sigh of relief when the last intern made it back to the office.
</p><p>Then it was the turn of senior reporters to fan out. One went to the stadium, another to the hospital near the stadium, and yet another to the mortuary at the government hospital.
</p><p>After gathering inputs from multiple sources, colleagues, and eyewitnesses, I wrote a detailed story on how the celebrations quickly turned into a tragedy. I ended up drawing a timeline, but it was not the one I had planned earlier. There were steady developments. Reporters kept filing stories — about the chaos, the mismanagement, the panic, and the grief — without a break. They filed enough stories to fill nearly all the city pages.
</p><p>At around 11 p.m., I was finally done with work. When I made my way back home, the air was heavy with mourning. The city, which had been alive with celebrations just 24 hours ago, had fallen completely silent.

</p><p>The tragic and unfortunate incident of passengers dying while travelling on a Mumbai local train shows that the Railways have miles to go in ensuring the safety of commuters. The overcrowding on these trains was a common sight especially during peak hours when I was a commuter between Thane and Mumbai CST in 1992. When we realise that not much has changed over three decades, it points to serious lapses in the planning, the development and the implementation of basic infrastructure, which is the lifeline of Mumbaikars. I have seen trains operating in Dubai and Japan, and I have travelled on the Dubai Metro for three years, from 2009.
</p><p>There are a few measures that the Railways and the Government can adopt to minimise such accidents. To flatten the peak in passenger volume, office hours can be staggered. The Railways can increase the frequency of local trains. Providing automatic sliding doors is also needed.
</p><p>More coaches and vestibules to connect them would be ideal.
</p><p>Jiji Panicker K.
</p><p>Chengannur, Kerala
</p><p>With over 80 lakh daily commuters, Mumbai’s suburban train system is arguably one of the busiest. Yet, overcrowding, outdated infrastructure, and a lack of real-time monitoring are hurdles. The incident serves as a grim reminder of the urgent need to modernise Mumbai’s railway system — not technologically alone, but also structurally and administratively.

(IRCTC) is one of India’s most widely used e-commerce platforms. Crores of Indian rail commuters and passengers use it to book their tickets, which makes it imperative that the system is run robustly. The scale of the operation is revealing — on May 22, 2025, the IRCTC processed a staggering 31,814 tickets in 60 seconds to set a new record. Yet, the popular e-ticketing system, especially the Tatkal booking part, is plagued by issues. Extremely high demand during peak hours, particularly during the designated Tatkal booking window period, often leads to crashes and slow performance. A major concern is that the system is exploited by ticketing agents who use unfair automated tools (or bots), leading to rapidly dwindling ticket availability for passengers. These issues are what prompted the IRCTC to announce two major steps. The first was a major digital overhaul of the ticketing infrastructure using anti-bot systems to prevent unauthorised automated bookings — a measure that led to the de-activation of a whopping 2.5 crore suspect user IDs. Implementation of a content delivery network also helped improve website performance. In addition, Aadhaar verification is necessary immediately after a ticket is booked. The IRCTC has also mandated Aadhaar authentication for all Tatkal bookings, from July 1, along with OTP-based authentication. Authorised agents have been restricted from booking Tatkal tickets during the first 30 minutes of the booking window period.</p><p>The idea behind an e-ticketing platform and the provision of Tatkal booking of tickets are to provide equitable chances for passengers to travel. Despite more train services having been introduced over the years by the Indian Railways, which is a state monopoly, demand far outstrips supply, and passengers have to rely on advanced booking and Tatkal tickets for their travel. When agents use bots to game the system, it kills the purpose of equity. Therefore, the IRCTC’s steps will bring relief to passengers. That said, the Indian Railways must focus not only on easing the process of ticketing but also on elevating the passenger experience in terms of increasing its train and track capacity to fulfil travel demand, ensuring safety and enhancing its facilities. Seen in this context, while these ticketing fixes are important, the true test for the Indian Railways will be its ability to move beyond just technical and administrative solutions and undertake a fundamental expansion of its services to serve India’s large passenger clientele. In a way, meaningful expansion to meet the demand will also obviate the need for reworking technological solutions yet again in the future.

</p><p>Tariffs are the substance of laws and regulations formulated after highly rigorous trade negotiations. The binding of tariffs through schedules of commitments in trade agreements, offers much needed certainty and predictability to businesses trading across borders. Which is why Mr. Trump’s sweeping tariffs — 10% to 135%, over 100 countries worldwide — were a stunning repudiation of the rules of trade. That it also extended to the barren Arctic marine reserves of Heard and McDonald Islands, uninhabited by humans, just highlighted the irony of a bizarre executive order.
</p><p>This sweeping executive action also upended the fundamental principle of separation of powers between the three branches of government — the legislature, the executive and the judiciary — which lie at the heart of any democratic constitutional framework. That such an exercise of executive authority could happen without any checks and balances in the U.S., widely regarded as among the modern world’s oldest democracies with a strong constitutional framework, was another point of reckoning.
</p><p>Five small and mid-sized U.S. businesses, dealing with wines, plastics, bicycles, musical circuits, and fishing equipment, took on the U.S. administration, and challenged the presidential executive order at the U.S. Court of International Trade (U.S. CIT), stating that the tariffs were unlawfully harming their operations and economic viability.
</p><h4>A closer look at ‘trade deficits’
</h4><p>The Trump administration argued that the tariffs were necessary to address the “national emergency” created by U.S.’ trade deficits with all countries worldwide. Trade deficit occurs when imports exceed exports. A “deficit” is not necessarily bad for a country’s economic health. It only demonstrates the availability of consumer wealth to purchase imported goods. In any event, the U.S. administration, bizarrely, did not account for U.S. export of services in its calculation. For example, the U.S. has cited the $44.4 billion trade deficit with India. This, however, does not consider trade in services (which includes digital services, financial services, education) and arms trade, after considering which, the Global Trade Research Initiative has estimated that the U.S. actually runs a $35 billion-$40 billion overall surplus with India.
</p><p>The U.S. CIT, in its judgment dated May 28, 2025, ruled that the worldwide and retaliatory tariffs exceeded any authority under law. The court cautioned against the blatant and overarching use of “national emergency” powers by the President. It noted that the mere incantation of “national emergency” cannot sound the “death-knell of the Constitution”, and, additionally, cannot enable the President to rewrite tariff commitments in international agreements.
</p><p>The strong and powerful ruling, so far, has had little practical impact, having been stayed the very next day by a U.S. appeals court. The tariffs and the threat of tariffs, therefore, continue, and so does the pressure to conclude a trade deal with the U.S. The Trump administration had in fact, argued before the U.S. CIT that the enhanced tariffs provided it leverage in trade negotiations — an argument which the CIT ruled does not in any manner mitigate its legal infirmity. More egregious U.S. executive actions are promised as part of the Trump One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) — a proposed omnibus law which would reportedly also grant the executive immunity from enforcement of judicial orders.
</p><h4>Where India stands
</h4><p>Where does all this really leave India? The governments of both countries have been indicating an early conclusion of a trade agreement, before the U.S. threat of the July 8 deadline. Despite ongoing negotiations, the U.S. has enhanced its existing punitive tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminium imports (in force since Mr. Trump’s first term), to 50% on both. Pursuant to complaints initiated at the World Trade Organization by Switzerland, Norway, China and Türkiye, WTO panels had ruled (in 2022) that the tariffs imposed during Mr. Trump’s first term, do not meet the proposed justification of national security. India too had initiated a WTO dispute, but withdrew this on the basis of a “mutually agreed solution” with the U.S. in 2023. That mutual solution clearly did not prevent Trump administration extending the new 50% tariffs on steel and aluminium to India as well. India’s contemplated retaliation at the WTO has been resisted by the U.S. A purported target of the Trump administration’s ire is China’s rise. The argument that the U.S.-China trade impasse presents a possible strategic advantage for India, however, is made uncertain by two recent developments: the U.S. and China’s truce, pausing their retaliatory tariffs against each other and working towards a negotiated solution; and, more importantly, the U.S. administration’s threats to impose tariffs on Apple’s products, should it manufacture in India. Mr. Trump’s transactional approach also indicates that there is no guarantee that the U.S. will intervene in India’s favour should there be a military standoff with China.
</p><h4>The path ahead
</h4><p>In any trade agreement with the U.S., therefore, a careful balancing of India’s interests is paramount. Any deal would need to ensure the removal of all additional tariffs on India’s exports, allay concerns about retaliatory tariffs on U.S. investments, such as that from Apple in India, and ensure that the proposed OBBB Act’s 3.5% tax on remittances sent from the U.S. does not apply to remittances by Indian citizens. India should also seek assurance that there would be no retaliation against India’s digital services taxes. A long-standing concern for India is also the fears and backlash against H-1B visas, used widely by tech companies for their Indian employees. It is critical for a trade deal to address the issue of visas required for services trade.
</p><p>It is equally important for both sides to iron out the delivery of cross-border trade in services, which includes aspects relating to data flows and their regulation.
</p><p>Above all, any trade agreement that India negotiates with the U.S. needs to be fully aligned with India’s commitments under the WTO. The U.S. disregard for multilateral institutions, notwithstanding, WTO’s multilateral set of rules is the only real safeguard in an uncertain world, and India needs to do much more to preserve its foundations, as committed during its G-20 presidency.
</p><p>Finally, India should have the ability to stay out of any sub-optimal deal. Mr. Trump’s tariffs, while painful, are likely to have a short lifespan with the biggest challenge emerging from within the U.S. itself.

He had also planned to arrest opposition politicians, including Lee Jae-myung, the head of the Democratic Party, his bête noire. But the move backfired dramatically, leading to his abrupt downfall and paving the way for Mr. Lee’s ascent to the presidency. In the June 3 election, which was necessitated by the impeachment of Mr. Yoon, Mr. Lee, a progressive liberal, won 49.4% votes, defeating Kim Moon-soo of Mr. Yoon’s conservative People Power Party, who secured 41.2% votes. The peaceful and democratic transition, following a period of chaos and turmoil, is a testament to the strong fundamentals of South Korea’s young democracy. For a nation that endured decades of brutal military dictatorship, the imposition of martial law was tantamount to cutting open the old wounds. South Koreans, both the political class and civilians, offered resistance. Mr. Yoon’s political collapse unfolded so fast that future leaders would think twice before undermining the country’s democratic institutions. Still, the election of Mr. Lee is only the first step in restoring order and stability.</p><p>Mr. Lee, who survived legal challenges and an assassination attempt last year, enters the Blue House with a strong mandate. His party is in a majority in the National Assembly, giving him legislative leeway. However, while those responsible for the martial law fiasco must be held accountable, he must resist the temptation to turn this into a political witch-hunt. On the economy front, Mr. Lee should take swift measures, including the implementation of a promised stimulus package to jump start growth. Just last month, the central bank cut the country’s full-year economic forecast by half to 0.8% amid trade and tariff concerns. In foreign policy, Mr. Lee faces a complex balancing act. During the campaign, he had said that the U.S. was “the basis axis of our diplomacy”, but expressed a desire to improve commercial ties with China, the largest trading partner. Under Mr. Yoon, relations with China took a hit, and tensions with North Korea escalated. In a first step to improve inter-Korean relations, Mr. Lee decided to turn off loudspeakers on the border that had been broadcasting K-pop songs and propaganda. He has said he does not want South Korea to be reliant only on the U.S. To that end, what he must do is to invest in peace on the Korean Peninsula and expand Seoul’s relationship with major powers, while preserving its strategic partnership with the U.S.</p><p> Published <span>- June 13, 2025 12:10 am IST</span></p></div></div><h2>Urbanisation and the challenge of ideal transit solutions</h2><div class="page" id="readability-page-1"><div id="content-body-69688213" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Among the various aspects of Viksit Bharat by 2047, an urbanised India is sure to be a principal one as it is expected that urban India will be the engine of growth in this transformation. Let us note that over 60% of India’s population would move from low-productive rural India to highly productive urban India by the 2060s.
</p><p>Clearly, the mobility of people on such a large scale within cities, from their residential quarters to work areas, will be a test for urban planners. While policymakers have plans to construct smart cities, where the need for the mobility of workers will be substantially reduced, the fact remains that, unlike China, we do not see many of the newly emerging smart cities coming of age. In contrast, the metros/existing tier 1 cities are on an ever-expanding spree, leading to rising challenges for policymakers, such as meeting the transportation demand of workers.
</p><h4>Rising to the challenge
</h4><p>The government is increasingly focused on augmenting the public transport system to meet the urban mobility challenge. This year’s Budget saw the launch of the PM e-Bus Sewa-Payment Security Mechanism, with the aim of improving urban bus transportation in India (nearly 10,000 urban buses). The PM Electric Drive Revolution in Innovative Vehicle Enhancement (PM e-Drive) scheme was introduced, which will support the procurement of 14,000 new e-buses, 1,10,000 e-rickshaws, e-trucks, and e-ambulances. However, according to estimates, India needs 2,00,000 urban buses, but only 35,000 are operational (including e-buses). This is far below the requirement.
</p><p>Another initiative has been the greater emphasis on building metro networks and a higher allocation of funds in multiple metro/tier I cities to cater to the high density. This is in line with the trend seen in the recent Budget.
</p><p>However, as the Economic Survey that was released on the eve of the Budget on January 31, has cited, only 37% of urban residents in India have easy access to public transportation. In contrast, in Brazil and China, more than 50% of urban residents have convenient access to mass transit. Clearly, India is too far behind in developing an efficient public system.
</p><p>The development of a metro network is a long-term and costly venture. Much of it has been developed with the Centre’s funding. And invariably, most have yet to recover their total costs (which includes fixed and operational costs). In almost all metros, the ridership projected in the project document has still to be matched. So, recovering the cost may be a difficult proposition unless the route lies along a high-density route. Also, it has been observed that users are extremely fare sensitive — a fare rise invariably leads to a fall in footfalls. Invariably, consumers seek out their ways keeping in mind comfort, time and cost due to the high cost of last-mile connectivity from metro stations to their work/residence points.
</p><p>Unlike in some developed countries where public transport is highly subsidised in order to make metro transportation cheap, our government is not financially rich enough to dole out recurrent and large subsidies.
</p><h4>Seeking alternatives
</h4><p>India also needs cost-effective, road-based public transport for better last-mile connectivity. This year’s Budget has increased allocations for urban bus systems, thus continuing efforts to boost capacity, especially in the metros. However, private investment remains limited due to uncertain returns. Government funds have shifted from CNG to more expensive e-buses. Future bottom-up transport models may focus on road-based modes that use electric, CNG, hydrogen, or biofuel technologies. Yet, they often overlook trams and trolleybuses, which, based on a life cycle cost and revenue analysis, can outperform e-buses in financial terms and deserve serious policy consideration in India’s urban transport planning.
</p><h4>Some estimates
</h4><p>Revenue generation and economic viability over time are the necessary parameters to estimate whether urban road-based public transport has a financial deficit or is making a profit in its life cycle. Analysing the profit and loss (P&amp;L) percentages for various public transport modes will help in accurate decision-making on adopting a future transit. We find that trams show a 45% long-term profitability over seven decades, the usual life cycle of the tram, along with scalability and alignment with climate goals. In contrast, an e-bus system, which is currently the preferred mode on Indian roads, fails to maintain profitability due to high operational and replacement costs, resulting in a net loss of 82% over seven decades. Though moderately efficient, trolleybuses fall short of matching the overall benefits of trams, incurring a minimal loss over the specified time frame.
</p><p>This raises a critical question. Are we truly investing in the most sustainable and cost-effective transit solutions, or are we chasing a future dependent on continuous public subsidies? The planned introduction of trams in Kochi could mark a game-changing moment in India’s urban mobility story. Reviving our past is not just a nostalgic choice of what Kolkata thinks — it is a smart and timely move toward a more sustainable and financially viable transport future.

Much like how music, television, and communication have moved to on-demand formats, education is undergoing its own decentralization. What was once viewed as the definitive route to career success, traditional degrees are now being re-evaluated for their time, cost, and long-term value. Today, learners are rethinking these conventional paths and increasingly turning to boot camps and nano-degrees—pragmatic, faster, and highly targeted alternatives built for the demands of a dynamic job market.</p><p>This shift is not just a passing trend. It has rather evolved as a fundamental change in how knowledge is acquired, validated, and applied. It has made education the one that aligns more closely with the needs of modern industries and the evolving aspirations of a new generation of learners who prioritize speed and flexibility.</p><h4>Rise of boot camps and nano degrees</h4><p>Traditional degree programs often follow a fixed, multi-year structure. They cover broad academic ground, but not always in ways that reflect current job demands. In contrast, boot camps and nano degrees offer shorter, modular programs designed around practical outcomes. Learners can now choose exactly what, when, and how they want to study. </p><p>These programs cover a wide range of high-demand skills in emerging fields like data science, web development, or blockchain. Many of these are offered by digital learning platforms and often in collaboration with major industry players. These bite-sized learning options allow students to build customized portfolios of credentials that are faster to earn, lighter on the wallet, and aligned with current hiring trends.</p><h4>What’s driving the shift</h4><p>The motivations behind this shift are clear. Boot camps and nano-degrees typically last a few months and cost a fraction of a conventional degree. Moreover, they equip learners with job-ready skills that are immediately applicable. On the other hand, four-year degree programs often take longer to adapt to changing industry needs. Much of their coursework remains static or includes subjects not directly relevant to the job market. </p><p>According to a report by Maximize Market Research, the global certificate market is anticipated to reach USD 7.59 billion by 2029. This growth reflects a broader demand for short-term, skill-centric learning that helps learners pivot quickly into new roles.</p><p>Tech companies are also no longer just consumers of talent—they’re becoming credentialing bodies themselves. For instance, some of the leading firms like Google, IBM, and Meta have launched their own certification and nano-degree programs. These credentials are gaining recognition and sometimes even outweigh traditional degrees in certain roles. </p><h4>A comparative perspective</h4><p>While both boot camps and traditional degrees aim to prepare learners for the workforce, they differ in delivery and design. </p><p>Nano-degrees and boot camps are intensive, focused, and are usually completed within a three to six-month timeframe. They are particularly well-suited for emerging disciplines such as web development, data analytics, or digital marketing. These programs are often designed with industry alignment in mind. </p><p>Entry requirements are minimal, and the flexibility of online or hybrid delivery models makes them accessible to a broad range of learners. This includes working professionals and learners from non-traditional backgrounds.</p><p>On the contrary, a four-year degree, such as a BTech in Computer Science or Mechanical Engineering from a reputed institution, offers broader academic exposure. They build foundational knowledge and critical thinking skills, which are crucial for roles in research, academia, or regulated professions. These programs still hold strong value for students pursuing advanced roles in engineering, management, or public service.</p><p>Both pathways serve different learner needs, and increasingly, they are being viewed as complementary rather than competitive. A graduate might turn to a boot camp for upskilling, while someone who started with a nano degree might pursue a full-time degree later for deeper specialization.</p><h4>Employer’s perspective</h4><p>A critical factor driving the popularity of alternative credentials is employer demand. There is an increasing disconnect between academic curricula and workplace expectations. Many employers now recognize that these alternative credentials often offer more relevant, up-to-date training. </p><p>In order to bridge this skills gap, employers are launching their own programs or endorsing third-party credentials. Some even allow professionals to showcase verified skills on professional networking platforms like LinkedIn, where practical competence can now stand on equal footing with academic qualifications. In high-growth sectors like IT, data science, cybersecurity, etc., many hiring managers now value demonstrable skills over a conventional degree, especially when backed by hands-on project experience.</p><h4>Looking ahead: Building a hybrid model</h4><p>Today, boot camps and nano-degrees represent more than a shortcut to employment; they symbolize a fundamental shift in how learners value, acquire, and apply knowledge. That being said, traditional degrees aren’t going away. They will remain vital for careers requiring deep theoretical grounding or licensure. But the idea that one must invest four years and several lakhs to be “employable” is being challenged.</p><p>Educational institutions now have an opportunity as well as a responsibility to adapt. The future will likely belong to hybrid models: traditional degrees combined with industry-recognized micro-credentials, delivered in a bite-sized format. </p><p>The question today’s students ask isn’t “Which college should I go to?” but “Which skills will get me hired faster and how quickly can I learn them?”</p><p>That’s the shift, and it’s here to stay.</p><p><i>(The author is founder and CEO of UniAthena)</i></p><p> Published <span>- June 12, 2025 05:17 pm IST</span></p></div></div>
