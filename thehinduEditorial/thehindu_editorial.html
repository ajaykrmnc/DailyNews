Ramadoss visited DMK leader M. Karunanidhi at his Gopalapuram residence to invite him for a family wedding. Karunanidhi did not miss the opportunity to rope the PMK into the DMK-led alliance, even though the PMK had contested the 2009 Lok Sabha elections as part of the AIADMK alliance. The PMK had failed to win a single seat in that election, despite being considered a powerful ally capable of tilting the scales of victory for any alliance. Yet, this perception of the party being a strong ally led Karunanidhi to generously allot 30 seats to the PMK and seal the alliance. However, the PMK managed to secure only three seats, proving that its decline had actually begun as early as 2009.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">Dr. Ramadoss, a medical doctor by qualification, has always played his political cards carefully, switching alliances from one election to another, but failing to gauge the shifting sands of Tamil Nadu politics. In 2009, the PMK suffered defeat by aligning with the AIADMK. It was routed again in the 2011 polls. The emergence of the Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam, led by actor Vijayakant, in 2005, also eclipsed the PMK’s influence in many areas.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">The party has never been able to reclaim its past glory, despite having been part of the Union government from 1998 to 2009. During that time, Anbumani Ramadoss, Dr. Ramadoss’s son, held the health portfolio (2004-09). Today, despite its organisational strength and the support of the Vanniyars, its core base, the party finds itself at a crossroads due to the growing rift between Dr. Ramadoss and Dr. Anbumani Ramadoss.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">In the 1980s, Dr. Ramadoss mobilised the Vanniyars by championing their claim for Most Backward Class status. After the DMK government led by Karunanidhi granted 20% reservation by grouping together several communities, including the Vanniyars, Ramadoss founded the PMK. In a symbolic gesture reminiscent of Piloo Mody, Dr. Ramadoss sent Panruti S. Ramachandran, the PMK’s lone MLA in 1991, to the Assembly riding an elephant — the symbol on which he won. The party performed well in the 1996, 2001, and 2006 Assembly elections.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">The PMK entered the national stage when Dr. Ramadoss joined the AIADMK-BJP alliance in 1998 and secured a Union Cabinet berth for Dalit Ezhilmalai, the party’s general secretary. He remained with the BJP even after Jayalalithaa toppled the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led government. This paid off as the BJP-DMK combine made good gains in 1999. The PMK was allotted two ministerial berths in the BJP-led government. In 2004, along with the DMK, it joined the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance, and Anbumani Ramadoss became a Union Minister in the Manmohan Singh government.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">Dr. Ramadoss, who once acted as a bridge between the Vanniyars and Dalits, also sought to shed the image of being a solely Vanniyar party by espousing Tamil identity and working closely with Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi leader Thol. Thirumavalavan and Tamil nationalist leader Pazha Nedumaran. However, successive electoral defeats forced him to take refuge in caste-based politics. He even ran a campaign targeting the Scheduled Castes (SCs), accusing their youth of wearing jeans and sunglasses and luring girls from other communities for their wealth. In 2012, the tragic death of Dharmapuri Ilavarasan, an SC man, who married Divya, a Vanniyar woman, caused deep damage to the PMK’s image. Since then, it has not been able to shed the ‘Vanniyar party’ image.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">The current war of words between father and son has crossed all limits and shocked observers who have followed the PMK for decades. Dr. Anbumani Ramadoss had always said that his father is his role model and has acknowledged his organisational skills.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">The absence of political power and influence seems to have made Dr. Ramadoss desperate and angry. He is probably making a last-ditch effort to secure a stable future for the party as the Tamil Nadu political space is too crowded. His ego does not permit even his son to interfere with his schemes. He knows well that Dr. Anbumani Ramadoss, who rose swiftly within the party ranks, could overshadow him, and he is not prepared for that. Neither his family members nor outsiders, including Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh ideologue S. Gurumurthy, can convince the unreconstructed Dr. Ramadoss.</p><div id="arthardpv"></div><div></div><div><div id="artproduct2"></div></div><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/Hindu_Desktop_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/Hindu_Desktop_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid05, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid05, publisher: The Hindu --></div><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Mweb_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Mweb_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle05, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle05, publisher: The Hindu --></div></div></div><div class="col-xl-9 col-lg-8 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-12 editorial" data-id="69683197" data-title="​Bad blood: On India-Canada ties   " data-url="https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/bad-blood-on-india-canada-ties/article69683197.ece"><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --></div><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --></div><h1 class="title" itemprop="name" style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
​Bad blood: On India-Canada ties   
</h1><h2 class="sub-title" style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 0.4em;">India and Canada must use every opportunity to reset ties</h2><div id="content-body-69683197" itemprop="articleBody"><p style="margin-bottom: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">Ten years after he last visited Canada, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will travel to Kananaskis, Alberta, as a special invitee to the G-7 summit outreach (June 15-17), with some hopes that the invitation from Prime Minister Mark Carney will give the two countries a chance to reset bilateral ties. Mr. Carney’s call to Mr. Modi last Friday took many by surprise, as it appeared to come at the last-minute, and possibly after some back-channel calls to ensure neither side would be embarrassed by the outcome. Under fire for the invitation despite a pending trial against Indian government agents in Canada, Mr. Carney said, quite rightly, that India, as a major world economic force, deserves to be part of the G-7 outreach deliberations. Regardless of the reasoning, both the invitation and its acceptance indicate a desire on both sides to take India-Canada ties out of the present lows. In the past two years, after former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau went public with thus far unsubstantiated allegations that India was behind the assassination of Khalistani activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, and was targeting other Canadian nationals, and RCMP officials even named Home Minister Amit Shah in the conspiracy, both countries have cut mission strengths down to a third. Canada suspended talks for a free trade agreement, while India temporarily stopped issuing visas to Canadians, citing persistent threats to Indian diplomats. Apart from considerable trade and investment, India and Canada are inextricably bound by their people — over 1.86 million are settled in Canada, but remain connected to India.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">Given the tough task ahead, teams preparing for the Carney-Modi meeting must work with the utmost sensitivity. While ties have nosedived since 2023, they have had a history of bad blood dating back to the 1970s, primarily over the Khalistan issue. It would be naive to imagine that these issues can be resolved in a summit, but a considered decision by both leaders to publicly show respect for each other’s positions is necessary. Returning the high commissioners and other diplomats to their posts is an imperative, along with a possible timeline for the restoration of trade talks. Speaking in Parliament, Mr. Carney said that Mr. Modi has agreed to a “law enforcement dialogue” where, no doubt, the Nijjar case and issues over Khalistani threats to Indian diplomats and community centres will come up, and the public messaging from the meeting will be the most important part of ensuring a path to improved relations. “Summit-level meetings” such as the one planned in Kananaskis can only open a door toward bettering ties; it is the necessarily tedious and painstaking talks behind the scenes that will actually allow the two countries to step through those doors and essay a different way of engaging each other.</p><div data-fragment-url="https://www.thehindu.com/fragment/getregionallist/69683197" id="reginallist"></div><div id="arthardpv"></div><div></div><div><div id="artproduct2"></div></div><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/Hindu_Desktop_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/Hindu_Desktop_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid05, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid05, publisher: The Hindu --></div><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Mweb_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Mweb_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle05, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle05, publisher: The Hindu --></div></div></div><div class="col-xl-9 col-lg-8 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-12 opinion" data-id="69683703" data-title="Recounting Velpur’s story in ending child labour" data-url="https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/recounting-velpurs-story-in-ending-child-labour/article69683703.ece"><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --></div><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --></div><h1 class="title" itemprop="name" style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
Recounting Velpur’s story in ending child labour

                                      </p></div><div id="content-body-69683703" itemprop="articleBody"><p style="margin-bottom: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">Every year, June 12 is observed as World Day Against Child Labor (WDACL) under the auspices of the International Labour Organization (ILO). In an attempt to draw the attention of the world on the issue of child labour, the day brings together governments, employers and workers’ organisations as well as civil society to work towards ending child labour. Though Sustainable Development Goal Target 8.7 calls on the global community to take effective measures to end child labour in all its forms by 2025, we are far from achieving this.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">Child labour is prevalent all over the world, robbing many children of their basic right to live with dignity, enjoy their childhood and attain their full development potential. Across the world, 160 million children are estimated to be involved in child labour — which is almost one among 10 children. The Africa, Asia and the Pacific regions together account for almost nine out of every 10 children being in child labour. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the situation for many underprivileged children, when their schools closed, and their parents lost their jobs/wages. Many children who dropped out of school, and who were forced to work to supplement their family income, have not returned to school.</p><h4 class="sub_head">The extent of child labour in India</h4><p style="margin-bottom: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">India has a significant incidence of child labour. Census 2011 estimated that 43.53 lakh children in the age group of five to 14 were involved in child labour due to factors such as poverty, non-accessibility and illiteracy. Child labour is preferred in beedi, carpet-weaving and firework factories.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">India enacted the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act (CLPRA) in 1986, while the National Policy on Child Labour, 1987 sought to adopt a gradual and sequential approach with a focus on rehabilitation. Its action plan included strict enforcement of the CLPRA and implementation of the National Child Labour Project (NCLP) in areas where there is a high incidence of child labour. The CLPRA was replaced with the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016, which prohibited the employment of children below 14 and had provisions for the prohibition on employment of adolescents (14-18 years) in scheduled hazardous occupations. The Right to Education now mandates that the state shall provide free and compulsory education to all children in the age group six to 14 years.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">Most drives against child labour have been effective but only for a short time. There are several instances of children who were engaged earlier in labour and who dropped out of school returning to their workplace. But there is a success story.</p><h4 class="sub_head">The Velpur model</h4><p style="margin-bottom: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">Velpur Mandal (tehsil) of Nizamabad district in erstwhile Andhra Pradesh (now Telangana), was once notorious for child labour. But in a dramatic way it became a rare exception of shunning child labour due to the total control, the commitment and the involvement of the local community. In June 2001, a drive involving the community was started in Velpur to ensure that all children in the age group of five to 15 years went to school and that no child would be engaged as labour in any form. After a sustained campaign for about 100 days, Velpur was declared to be a “child labour free mandal”, on October 2, 2001. Twenty-four years later, there is 100% retention in schools and no child labour in a mandal once notorious for it.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">The campaign to identify and track every out-of-school child and enrol them in schools was initially led by a committed set of officials. But the fact is that there was large-scale resistance in the beginning. Canards were spread that the teams moving in villages were part of a nationwide racket to kidnap children and sell their organs such as kidneys and eyes. Hotels refused to serve even tea, with those in hotels making sarcastic remarks that all their servers had joined school.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">But after persistent efforts and discussions with the people, the tide began to turn. People began to cooperate and even transformed it as their movement. Children who were seen in work places were sent to bridge schools under the NCLP. Public meetings emphasised the necessity of education and the need for children to go to school. In these meetings, children recognised their (former) employers who let them stop work and go to school.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">Under peer pressure, former employers also made a public announcement of writing off the balance amount (principal, the interest and penal interest) owed to them by the parents who took hand loans from them (the children were used as mortgage and as child labour till the amount was repaid). They even distributed school stationery to the children.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">A study found that a total amount of about ₹35 lakh was written off — the price for a good cause. All sarpanchs signed a memorandum of understanding (as in the provisions of the Andhra Pradesh Compulsory Primary Education Rules, 1982), with the government (district education officer in the presence of the District Collector) to ensure that all children in the five to 14 age group in their village were sent to school. The government in turn undertook to provide access, infrastructure and teachers. This was the first time that such an agreement had been signed between sarpanchs and the government. There is no child labour — an achievement that is very zealously guarded by the community. To cherish this proud achievement of being the first mandal in the State to be declared child labour free and to remind them of their commitment to sustain it, villagers erected boards in every village with the words, ‘There is no child labour in our village’.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">On October 8, 2021, as a part of the ‘Azadi ka Amruth Mahotsav’, the V.V. Giri National Labour Institute, (VVGNLI) Noida, Uttar Pradesh (under the Ministry of Labor and Employment, Government of India) organised a programme in Nizamabad. The event was to celebrate 20 years of successful intervention “to eliminate child labour and the declaration of Veilpur Mandal, as Child labour free”. All sarpanchs, caste elders, zilla parishad members and people involved in the campaign were honoured for their role in sustaining it. The challenge made to the local media to identify at least one child who was not in school had no takers. A leading news magazine had an exclusive report on this event.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">The Velpur story is well documented and has been appreciated by the ILO and the media. Velpur has been visited by many experts in the fields of education and child labour. The former President of India, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, and members of the National Human Rights Commission India sent letters of appreciation.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">The Velpur model, where there was the complete participation of the community in sustaining the fight against child labour, is an integral part of all training programmes that are organised by the VVGNLI. Made aware of its sustained success, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Labour, Textiles and Skill Development asked the then District Collector, who led this campaign, to make a presentation before it on November 24, 2022.

A needless controversy over ‘Bharat Mata’
<div><span>Premium</span></div></h1><h2 class="sub-title" style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 0.4em;">The RSS cannot foist its ideological and political preoccupations upon official functions</h2><div><div><!--[if IE 9]><video style="display: none;"><![endif]--><img src="/Users/ajaymac/Desktop/raw project/DailyNews/DailyNews/images/Arlekar-BharatMata.jpg"/><!--[if IE 9]></video><![endif]--></div><p class="caption" style="margin-bottom: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">

                                      </p></div><div id="content-body-69682541" itemprop="articleBody"><p style="margin-bottom: 1em; line-height: 1.6;"><span class="drop-caps">R</span>ecently, an unexpected and unwarranted controversy erupted in Kerala in connection with World Environment Day, which is observed annually on June 5. Unfortunately, it was triggered by Raj Bhavan.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">In Kerala, World Environment Day is widely observed every year. There is massive participation from the people, who plant thousands of saplings across the State. The day has become an occasion for the people to enrich their understanding of the environment and commitment to the cause of it.</p><h4 class="sub_head">The proposal</h4><p style="margin-bottom: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">This year, the Department of Agriculture decided to conduct the inaugural function of World Environment Day at the premises of Raj Bhavan. The Governor, Rajendra Viswanath Arlekar, graciously agreed to inaugurate the event. On the eve of the function, while communicating the details of the programme to the Agriculture Minister’s office, Raj Bhavan proposed that a new practice be followed and floral tributes be paid to a painting. On receiving this proposal, the Minister’s office requested for more clarification. The Governor’s office responded by sending a photograph of the painting, claiming it was the image of ‘Bharat Mata’. Surprisingly, the image was the same one used by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) during its functions. Raj Bhavan’s version depicted Bharat Mata sitting on a lion and holding a saffron flag, which resembled the flag of the RSS. In the backdrop of the painting was a map — and it was certainly not the map of the Indian Republic.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">After some consultations, the Minister informed the Governor’s office that it is improper to use and glorify such an image at an official function organised by the government. But due to reasons known only to him, the Governor insisted that the function would not be conducted without that image and with his participation. The government was forced to change the venue to the premises of the Secretariat. Every dignitory participated except the Governor.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">Reportedly, during the function conducted in Raj Bhavan, the Governor glorified the saffron flag-holding Bharat Mata. He argued that it is the symbol of India. He also criticised the Kerala government and all those who were not ready to uphold his concept of Bharat Mata.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">Under the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government at the Centre, controversies between the Governors and State governments have taken place not just in Kerala but also elsewhere. The Supreme Court has intervened in some of these instances. Now, thanks to Governor Arlekar, even Bharat Mata has taken centre stage in these controversies.</p><h4 class="sub_head">A dynamic concept</h4><p style="margin-bottom: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">Bharat Mata is a concept with deep roots in the collective consciousness of the people of India. During the anti-colonial struggle, it was used by various groups with different sociopolitical orientations to inspire and unify all sections of society in the struggle for Independence. Nobody can argue that any particular version is the ‘real’ expression and face of Bharat Mata. This is a broad concept.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">Bharat Mata has been interpreted by many according to their own concepts of nation, nationality, and world view. Over the course of time, the RSS, for its own purposes, may have come up with its own idea of Bharat Mata. Governor Arlekar as an individual has the right to believe that the Bharat Mata of the RSS is the only true portrait of the concept. Those with a particular ideological persuasion have the right to think that Bharat Mata should be holding a saffron flag. They would also appreciate finding her seated on a lion. For them, it is also befitting to have a specially drawn map in the backdrop of the painting of their Bharat Mata.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">As per its ideological and organisational framework, the RSS has come up with a particular image of Bharat Mata that suits its dream of a ‘Akhand Bharat’ and its militant aggressive nationalism. In RSS shakhas, this version of Bharat Mata may be eulogised. But conceptions of Bharat Mata are abstract and varied. It is futile to impose any one version as the only acceptable and authentic version. The matter becomes even more complicated when the RSS tries to foist its ideological and political preoccupations upon official functions. Governor Arlekar, who has great experience in public life, is expected to know this basic principle. Those who hold constitutional positions cannot show their political leanings. The dividing line between their political commitment and official responsibility should be deeply inscribed in their minds.</p><h4 class="sub_head">What Nehru said</h4><p style="margin-bottom: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">The Governor, and the people who follow his ideological track, may not be happy with former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru for various reasons. But Nehru must be remembered on this occasion. He wrote, “Sometimes as I reached a gathering, a great roar of welcome would greet me: Bharat Mata ki Jai — Victory to Mother India. I would ask them unexpectedly what they meant by that cry, who was this Bharat Mata... India was all this that they had thought, but it was much more. The mountains and the rivers of India, and the forests and the broad fields... were all dear to us, but what counted ultimately were the people of India, people like them and me, who were spread out all over this vast land. Bharat Mata, Mother India, was essentially these people. You are parts of this Bharat Mata, I told them, you are in a manner yourselves Bharat Mata, and as this idea slowly soaked into their brains, their eyes would light up as if they had made a great discovery.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 1em; line-height: 1.6;"><b><i>Binoy Viswam, Secretary, Communist Party of India National Council, and former Rajya Sabha MP</i></b></p><div id="arthardpv"></div><div></div><div><div id="artproduct2"></div></div><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/Hindu_Desktop_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/Hindu_Desktop_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid05, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid05, publisher: The Hindu --></div><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Mweb_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Mweb_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle05, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle05, publisher: The Hindu --></div></div></div><div class="col-xl-9 col-lg-8 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-12 editorial" data-id="69683163" data-title="​Connecting bridge: On the Chenab Rail Bridge  " data-url="https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/connecting-bridge-on-kashmir-india-and-the-chenab-rail-bridge/article69683163.ece"><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --></div><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --></div><h1 class="title" itemprop="name" style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
​Connecting bridge: On the Chenab Rail Bridge  
</h1><h2 class="sub-title" style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 0.4em;">The rail link will bring Kashmir closer to the rest of India </h2><div id="content-body-69683163" itemprop="articleBody"><p style="margin-bottom: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">‘Kashmir to Kanniyakumari’ is a figurative expression to denote the geographical expanse of India, from its northernmost point to its southern tip, and for the first time in history these are connected by rail. With the inauguration of the 272-kilometre Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla Rail Link (USBRL) project which has been 28 years in the making, the Kashmir Valley has been connected to the national rail network. The tough, unsurmountable topography of the Himalayas challenged the engineering capabilities of the Indian Railways, but it has come out with flying colours. The engineering marvel, the Chenab Rail Bridge, that stands 35 metres higher than the Eiffel Tower, is the world’s highest railway arch bridge at 359 metres above the riverbed. Spanning 1,315 m, it will endure wind speeds of up to 260 km per hour and has been built to last 120 years. Nearby, the Anji Khad Bridge, rises boldly across the rugged terrain as India’s first cable-stayed railway bridge. Towering 331 m above the riverbed and stretching 725 m across, it is anchored by 96 high-tensile cables; 8,200 metric tonnes of structural steel went into its construction. Built at a cost of ₹43,780 crore, the USBRL link witnessed drilling of mountains to set up 36 tunnels that span 119 kilometres and 943 bridges through ridges and mountain passes.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">Kashmir’s decades of geographical isolation have finally come to an end. The Vande Bharat Express between Srinagar in the Kashmir region and Katra in the Jammu region, which was also flagged off by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, cuts the surface journey to three hours between the two points. Later this year, a scheduled direct train service between the national capital New Delhi and Srinagar will allow commuters to touch base in just 13 hours compared to over 24 hours in the past. The Vande Bharat Express, a long-distance high-speed service, is bound to end the psychological barriers, multiply the development dividend and act as a game changer for the economy of Jammu and Kashmir (J&amp;K). The train service has brought renewed hope to the region not long after the Pahalgam terror attack in April 2025 pushed India and Pakistan to a short conflict. India’s ‘Operation Sindoor’, against terror infrastructure across the border, saw Pakistan ending the ceasefire agreement and targeting civilians, leaving 18 dead and over 1,500 houses damaged. While inaugurating the train service in Katra, Mr. Modi rightly described the rail link as “a symbol of a new, empowered J&amp;K”. The bridge will go a long way to bring the people of Kashmir closer to the rest of India.</p><div data-fragment-url="https://www.thehindu.com/fragment/getregionallist/69683163" id="reginallist"></div><div id="arthardpv"></div><div></div><div><div id="artproduct2"></div></div><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/Hindu_Desktop_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/Hindu_Desktop_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid05, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid05, publisher: The Hindu --></div><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Mweb_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Mweb_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle05, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle05, publisher: The Hindu --></div></div></div><div class="col-xl-9 col-lg-8 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-12 opinion" data-id="69683730" data-title="It is profit first, life and safety second" data-url="https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/it-is-profit-first-life-and-safety-second/article69683730.ece"><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --></div><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --></div><h1 class="title" itemprop="name" style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">

Chinnaswamy Stadium to celebrate the victory of Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB), after RCB’s first-ever Indian Premier League (IPL) title in 2025, is a stark reminder of three issues. They are our national sense of disproportionate enthusiasm for victory; of government machinery and the lack of preparedness to contain crowd movement, and of people’s sense of immortality. Despite knowing full well that such gatherings end as physically unsafe situations, we see people rush madly, throwing caution to the winds. Social media in particular and 24X7 visual media houses play a great role in adding much hype to these events. It is almost as if missing such an opportunity is akin to foregoing the most important part in one’s life.</p><h4 class="sub_head">The aim is profits</h4><p style="margin-bottom: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">Cricket, especially in India, has become a great money-spinning industry. Hence, those in charge do everything possible to draw in large crowds. The risk that such gatherings pose is known. Every such event results in crowds of people who are far more in number than the capacity of the venues. More footfalls spell more profits for every one in the business.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">It is common knowledge that the licences and the necessary permissions for hosting such events are not granted by merely adhering to the rules and the regulations on paper. Much of these are linked to the ‘showering of bounties’ on those in power. Here is an example that happened during this IPL season. In a reported case during an RCB versus Chennai Super Kings match, in early May 2025, at the Chinnaswamy Stadium, the family of an Indian Police Service (IPS) officer fought with the family of an Indian Revenue Service (IRS) officer over free seating in the VIP gallery. The case resulted in a first information report being filed. While the many uncomfortable galleries are filled up in no time by those who pay for them, the VIP enclosures, which have the best seats and stadium and field views, are generally occupied by those who wield power and enjoy the freebies.</p><div data-ga-label="AlsoReadArticle"><div><div>
									Stampede deaths: Individual preparedness crucial for safety in public spaces, say doctors</div><div></div></div></div><p style="margin-bottom: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">An industry which is most lucrative, with millions made in profits, offers paltry sums of money as compensation/solatium for those who lost their life in the stampede in Bengaluru. No amount of money can ever compensate the loss for the families concerned, and it only goes to show the scant respect and value for a common person’s life.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">It is time that whenever there is a gathering for an event that is governed by economic considerations and motives of profit, there is also provision made for a suitable caution deposit. With the said deposit money, the state ought to ensure the security and the safety of spectators or attendees.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">When a small hall is granted a licence, the mandatory requirements include the number of entrance and exit points, the seating arrangements, a doctor on call, public conveniences, appropriate audio/visual systems and even parking facilities. Therefore, it is shocking that there is scant observance of safety requirements when very large crowds gather in closed/open air stadiums. Compliance with the rules and regulations is very poor in many such instances.</p><h4 class="sub_head">Scant safety</h4><p style="margin-bottom: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">The concept of public safety in public spaces is practically absent. For example, food fairs are held in an unsafe manner and one finds open wiring running all over the floor. There is no safety when stoves are lit and there is large-scale food preparation that are done under combustible camping structures. There is no sense of fear and safety measures are ‘more honoured in the breach, than the observance’. In an incident in Chennai, there were reports of several visitors at an amusement park stranded for hours on a giant wheel after the device experienced technical problems. They had to be rescued by the fire services department.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">We, as a country, have no value for life. Most of our roads have no pedestrian walkways. There are no tracks marked for slow-moving vehicles. Motor cars and bullock carts traverse along the same roads in a fight for space. There is no respect for the pedestrian, who in turn faces grave danger in the form of speeding automobiles, broken pavements and aggressive stray animals.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">The 11 dead in a stampede or the thousands of persons who die on our roads are just cold statistics for us. We have learnt to brush aside such tragic incidents by blaming it on karma. There are no lessons learnt. There is no accountability. Some officials are suspended while others are transferred. These are sure to be revoked at a later date.</p><h4 class="sub_head">Introduce a culture of audits</h4><p style="margin-bottom: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">The need is to have a detailed and scientific study of crowd management by experts and execute their findings in an earnest way. A country with a population that has hit 146.39 crore cannot afford to falter on this issue. Without such an audit, it cannot call itself a civilised and advanced country and a nation that is safe for all its citizens. Every life is precious and there must be a dedication to ensure the safety of all.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">Let us not lose life and limb by promoting the commerce of and the gains for the rich. Those who are hurt are mortals who fight battles every day for their daily bread. It is unfortunate that this too will pass with no lessons learnt.
