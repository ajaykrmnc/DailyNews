But this is not a new idea; it has existed within the Tamil discourse for two centuries. Robert Caldwell and other linguists have said Dravidian languages branched off from a shared language, termed Proto-Dravidian. However, Tamil nationalists have never accepted this view. They have claimed that all Dravidian languages are offshoots of Tamil. At its peak, this belief extended to proclaiming that Tamil is the world’s first language and that all other world languages were born from it.</p><h4 class="sub_head">The more acceptable idea</h4><p>Even today, these two schools of thought continue to thrive in the Tamil intellectual space. The idea of a Proto-Dravidian language has gained traction beyond Tamil Nadu. In contrast, the notion that Tamil is the source of all languages has little traction or acceptance outside. We now live at a time when awareness around linguistic dominance has grown politically in India’s multilingual context. Every national group tends to hold its language as the primary marker of its identity. Any idea or action that is perceived as one that diminishes their linguistic pride often invites a fierce backlash.</p><p>In such a climate, it is more appropriate on public platforms to affirm the idea that all Dravidian languages emerged from a common Proto-Dravidian root. Culturally and politically, this view fosters harmony and equality. To say other languages came from Tamil can easily be perceived by others as demeaning to their language and identity. They may see such a claim as a form of dominance imposed on them. For Tamil nationalists, who mix ancestral pride with political messaging, such assertions may help construct a narrative of ancient greatness. But beyond that, in contemporary politics, this view only serves to isolate Tamil Nadu. Without strong, widely accepted academic evidence, there is no need to insist that Tamil is the source of all languages.</p><div><div><div><div id="botr_mfe1UbWw_HxxKTB2U_div"></div><div id="botr_mfe1UbWw_lUyqynWW_div"></div></div></div><div>
                    "I won't apologize if I am not wrong" Kamal Haasan on Kannada-Tamil controversy
                </div></div><p>The classical attributes of Tamil — its antiquity, literary richness, and unbroken literary tradition — are well known to other language communities and to the world at large. Merely presenting these strengths is enough to bring honour to Tamil. Even when compared with modern literature of any Indian language, Tamil literature stands equal, if not superior. What we need are conscious efforts to take this richness of Tamil to a wider world.</p><p>In 2022, Hindi writer Geetanjali Shree won the International Booker Prize. This year, Kannada writer Banu Mushtaq received the same honour. Tamil, too, deserves to be taken to such global heights. What we need is a sustained cultural effort in that direction — not the unproductive habit of making provocative statements that alienate speakers of other languages.</p><p>When Mr. Haasan said “Kannada was born from Tamil,” his intent was not to insult that language. Kannada actor Shivarajkumar was on stage, and Mr. Haasan was speaking with pride about his warm relationship with that family. He was pointing to the kinship between Tamil and Kannada and was trying to say ‘we are family; ours are sibling languages’. It is likely that in that moment, the idea that ‘Tamil is the origin’ — an idea long held by a section of Tamil thinkers — came to his mind. But there is no reason to doubt his intentions. He has the freedom to express such a view in public. Those who hold opposing views can disagree, and speak or write in response. But to issue threats to him is a violation of his right to express an opinion.</p><h4 class="sub_head">The court’s view</h4><p>When a case regarding the release of his film Thug Life came before the court in Karnataka, the judge almost compelled Mr. Haasan to apologise. While linguistic fundamentalists are prepared to turn this into a conflict between two regional nationalities, should the court be approaching it in a way that favours them? The police may treat this as a law-and-order issue, but the court cannot view it that way. Should the court function like a kattapanchayat (extrajudicial body) enforcing commercial compromise?</p><div data-ga-label="AlsoReadArticle"><div><div>
									Caldwell’s ‘Comparative Grammar of Dravidian Languages’ is a fake book, says R.N. Ravi  </div><div></div></div></div><p>The court should have treated this as an issue of freedom of expression. Anyone can say they are hurt by a particular view, but what is the measure of being hurt? Anyone can deliberately create social tension. The court cannot consider such people as a party to compromise. The court should have said that it will carefully examine whether Mr. Haasan has the right to express such a view; that this has no relation to the release of the film; and that it will allow the film’s release with police protection. Whatever way the case came before the court, it should have been approached from the standpoint of freedom of expression. In a democracy, the court is the final refuge that safeguards that right.</p><p>Mr. Haasan did not apologise. He explained that “the opinion was not wrong; it was misunderstood.” Normally, if any issue arises around a film, the standard response is to issue an immediate apology, remove scenes, and make compromises to facilitate the film’s release. For the first time, someone from the film industry has said, “I will not apologise.”</p><div><div><div><div id="botr_gzFqRlSA_HxxKTB2U_div"></div><div id="botr_gzFqRlSA_lUyqynWW_div"></div></div></div><div>

                </div></div><p>Whatever commercial calculations may lie behind that stance, the courage to make such a statement must be acknowledged. As the court itself said, this is not a matter of arrogance, but of self-respect. A person has every right to express an opinion and to stand by it if they believe it is right. Democratic opposition to such views can certainly be voiced. But issuing violent threats or denying someone their right to live must be treated as punishable crimes.</p><p><i>Perumal Murugan, scholar and literary chronicler who writes in the Tamil language</i></p><div id="arthardpv"></div><div></div><div><div id="artproduct2"></div></div><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/Hindu_Desktop_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/Hindu_Desktop_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid05, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid05, publisher: The Hindu --></div><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Mweb_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Mweb_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle05, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle05, publisher: The Hindu --></div></div></div><div class="col-xl-9 col-lg-8 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-12 columns" data-id="69672037" data-title="Corrections and Clarifications — June 9, 2025 " data-url="https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/Readers-Editor/corrections-and-clarifications/corrections-and-clarifications-june-9-2025/article69672037.ece"><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --></div><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --></div><h1 class="title" itemprop="name">

​Influencing interlocutors: On Operation Sindoor, India’s delegations 
</h1><h2 class="sub-title">The delegations projected a united image of pluralistic India </h2><div id="content-body-69671556" itemprop="articleBody"><p>The seven Indian delegations of mostly Members of Parliament and some former diplomats, tasked by the government to carry diplomatic messages after Operation Sindoor, have completed their travels. The 59 members visited 32 countries to convey the country’s position on the outrage felt over the Pahalgam terror attack and its links to Pakistan, the restrained and precise nature of Indian strikes on Pakistan’s terrorist infrastructure, and the “new normal” the government has adopted for terrorist strikes. The message was meant not just for foreign governments but also for lawmakers, the foreign media and the general public, especially in countries where New Delhi has felt it has not found the expected support. Many of the countries visited are members of the UN Security Council (UNSC), and include those which are elected non-permanent members or will join next year. This is important as India faced a diplomatic setback when Pakistan, an elected UNSC member for 2025-26, was able to amend the UNSC statement to omit references to The Resistance Front (TRF) that had claimed responsibility for the Pahalgam attack. That Pakistan managed to be chosen Chair of the Taliban Sanctions committee and Vice-Chair of the UN Counter-terrorism Committee will make India’s task of holding the terrorists responsible for the attack accountable through UN designations and at the Financial Action Task Force more difficult. Another area of focus was the membership of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation that has been particularly critical of India. Finally, the focus on the U.S. was pointed, where the delegation visited New York and Washington. This may have stemmed from the appearance that ties with Washington are strained over President Donald Trump’s persistent claim that he had mediated the ceasefire between India and Pakistan, using trade ties as a leverage to avert a “nuclear conflict”.</p><p>It remains to be seen just how successful these tours of political diplomacy have been, given criticism in India that more time was spent speaking to the Indian diaspora, and giving interviews to the accompanying Indian media rather than in influencing interlocutors abroad. The delegations also had to contend with a copy-cat move from Pakistan to counter the Indian narrative. However, the overarching message of the delegations, comprising representatives from a number of Indian States, faiths and political parties, is a powerful one — of Indian unity and consensus on the issue of national security. At a time when the Modi government is under criticism internationally for “democratic decline” and increasing majoritarianism, New Delhi chose its messengers wisely, with a view to projecting abroad a positive and pluralistic image of a country that was resolute against terrorism.</p><div data-fragment-url="https://www.thehindu.com/fragment/getregionallist/69671556" id="reginallist"></div><div id="arthardpv"></div><div></div><div><div id="artproduct2"></div></div><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/Hindu_Desktop_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/Hindu_Desktop_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid05, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid05, publisher: The Hindu --></div><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Mweb_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Mweb_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle05, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle05, publisher: The Hindu --></div></div></div><div class="col-xl-9 col-lg-8 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-12 opinion" data-id="69672003" data-title="Judicial sensitivity to sentiments is a sign of regression" data-url="https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/judicial-sensitivity-to-sentiments-is-a-sign-of-regression/article69672003.ece"><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --></div><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --></div><h1 class="title" itemprop="name">

And in this curious inversion of constitutional values, we are witnessing a quiet retreat from the principle that animated Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution: that speech, even provocative, offensive, or unsettling, is the citizen’s shield against tyranny — not its tool.</p><p>Once envisioned as the counter-majoritarian bulwark of our democracy, the judiciary now increasingly resembles an arbiter of decorum, demanding apologies and deference in the name of civility, sensitivity, or national pride. But when courts focus on what was said rather than why the right to say it must be protected, the Republic is left vulnerable to a new tyranny: that of sentiment, outrage, and the lowest tolerance denominator.</p><p>Let us begin with a chillingly ordinary example: a social media post by a 24-year-old man criticising Prime Minister Narendra Modi. after the ceasefire with Pakistan following Operation Sindoor in May 2025. Was this tasteless? Perhaps. But taste is not a constitutional metric. The Allahabad High Court thought otherwise. In rejecting the plea to quash the first information report (FIR), the Bench declared that “emotions cannot be permitted to overflow to an extent that constitutional authorities of the country are dragged into disrepute”. That is a remarkable formulation. It subtly inverts the constitutional design: the citizen is no longer the source of power holding the state to account, but a child to be reprimanded for speaking too freely.</p><div data-ga-label="AlsoReadArticle"><div><div>
									Operation Sindoor 2025 | Complete coverage from The Hindu</div><div></div></div></div><h4 class="sub_head">A validation of outrage</h4><p>Instead of interpreting Article 19(1)(a) as a liberty that limits state power, courts have begun treating it as a licence that comes with behavioural conditions — conditions defined not by law but by the perceived dignity of public figures and institutions. Take the Kamal Haasan controversy in connection with his film, <i>Thug Life</i>. The actor made a remark about Kannada being a daughter of Tamil. The Karnataka High Court responded not by evaluating whether the actor’s statement met the threshold of incitement, defamation, or hate, but by advising him to apologise to the “sentiments of the masses”. This advice is corrosive. When courts suggest apologies for lawful speech, they set a precedent that expression must pass a popularity test. They validate the very outrage that threatens free speech, rather than shielding expression from it. An apology does not close the loop but only widens it, inviting further claims of offence. In <i>Ranveer Gautam Allahabadia vs Union Of India</i>, the ‘digital content creator and podcaster’ was confronted with judicial comments bordering on cultural supervision for his use of explicit language in a podcast. The court directed the Union to clarify whether such “vulgar” language fell outside constitutional protection. Here again, the concern was not whether the speech incited harm, but on whether it offended prevailing norms of taste and modesty — a dangerously subjective threshold. Similarly, historian and a professor, Ali Khan Mahmudabad, was dragged into proceedings after sharing critical views on the optics of India using a woman soldier to explain its war situation with Pakistan. The argument was that his comments hurt sentiments. That it even reached court underscores the problem: invoking hurt feelings is now sufficient to invite judicial scrutiny of constitutionally protected speech. The professor’s scholarly critique became a matter for judicial assessment and a special investigation to assess whether there was any dog whistle intent that played on the fragility of the audience.</p><div data-ga-label="AlsoReadArticle"><div><div>
									Why Supreme Court’s order in Mahmudabad’s case signals a shift in free speech jurisprudence </div><div></div></div></div><h4 class="sub_head">A misreading</h4><p>Two disturbing patterns emerge from these cases.</p><p>First, the judiciary is increasingly equating speech that provokes emotional reactions with legally actionable harm. This misreads the Constitution and the rationale of a democracy. The test for restricting speech under Article 19(2) is not whether it angers, irritates, or offends but whether it incites violence, hatred or disrupts public order. Second, by encouraging apologies and moral policing of language, courts create a perverse incentive. The more outrage a comment generates, the more likely it is to be litigated. This does not protect society. It emboldens mobs and serial litigants. It creates a market for offence.</p><p>This shift is starkly evident in cases that involve the armed forces. In a recent judgment, the Allahabad High Court denied the Leader of the Opposition, Rahul Gandhi, relief in a defamation case on his alleged derogatory remarks about the Indian Army . The High Court said that the freedom of speech does not include the freedom to “defame” the military. But defamation, as a legal standard, must be carefully assessed particularly when invoked by or on behalf of state institutions by busy-bodies.</p><p>Likewise, in a previous first information report against a man using the word “coward” to describe the Prime Minister after the recent military stand-down, the court saw no issue with Sections 152 and 353(2) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita being invoked — laws meant for threats to sovereignty and public mischief . These laws, meant for sedition-like scenarios, are being contorted to punish sarcasm and satire. It is telling that courts will routinely deny the quashing of FIRs in such cases, claiming that it is too early to interfere and that police investigations must run their course. But this abdication is neither neutral nor passive. For the citizen facing criminal prosecution, the process itself is the punishment. The system does not need a conviction to chill speech. A summons and a charge sheet do the job. The Madras High Court has occasionally resisted this drift. But this was more about narrative correction than structural protection of speech.</p><p>Courts in India must return to a principle-centric model of speech protection. Instead of obsessing over what was said, they must ask whether the speaker’s right was violated, and not someone else’s sentiment. Apologies should not be judicial recommendations. They should be individual choices. Otherwise, courts become confessional booths where speech is absolved not by legal reasoning but by remorse. And remorse demanded is remorse devalued — it empowers the outraged, not the rational.</p><h4 class="sub_head">The signal to the citizen</h4><p>Moreover, as long as laws such as sedition or the ever-morphing public order clauses remain vague, courts must lean toward liberty. The doctrine of “chilling effect” that is robust in American and European jurisprudence, has been acknowledged in India’s courts but seldom enforced with spine. This is not just about high-profile speech or celebrities. It is about the slow attrition of constitutional confidence. When a YouTuber is told to bleep a joke, or a professor is dragged to court for a tweet, or a film-maker is told to grovel for linguistic pride the signal to the ordinary citizen is clear: express only what is safe, bland and agreeable.</p><p>But democracies are not built on agreeable speech. They thrive on disagreement — noisy, rude, even reckless at times. The test of a society’s strength is not how well it tolerates politeness, but how it handles provocation. Free speech is not just about giving offence, but about withstanding it. If India is to preserve its democratic soul, it must restore the dignity of dissent. It must not demand the dignity of institutions at the cost of liberty.</p><p>Judges are the guardians of the Constitution, and not the curators of culture. They must protect the right to speak and not the comfort of the listener. Because when speech is chilled in courtrooms, freedom dies not with a bang, but with a sigh of deference. The new age of judicial sensitivity to sentiments is not a sign of progress. It is a sign of regression. It confuses harmony with homogeneity, and respect with restraint. Apologies should never be a legal strategy. And speech should not need blessings to be legitimate. Let our courts not forget that the Republic was not born from politeness but from protest. The Constitution came from the pen of a Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, who also wrote, “…the world owes much to rebels who would dare to argue in the face of the pontiff and insist that he is not infallible”.</p><p><b><i>Sanjay Hegde is a Senior Advocate of the Supreme Court of India</i></b></p><div id="arthardpv"></div><div></div><div><div id="artproduct2"></div></div><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/Hindu_Desktop_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/Hindu_Desktop_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid05, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid05, publisher: The Hindu --></div><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Mweb_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Mweb_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle05, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle05, publisher: The Hindu --></div></div></div><div class="col-xl-9 col-lg-8 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-12 storyline" data-id="69672109" data-title="Using religion for political gains" data-url="https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/using-religion-for-political-gains/article69672109.ece"><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --></div><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --></div><h1 class="title" itemprop="name">
Using religion for political gains
<div><span>Premium</span></div></h1><h2 class="sub-title">Religious issues are increasingly dominating political narratives in Andhra</h2><div><div><!--[if IE 9]><video style="display: none;"><![endif]--><img src="/Users/ajaymac/Desktop/raw project/DailyNews/DailyNews/images/A.P.jpg"/><!--[if IE 9]></video><![endif]--></div></div><div id="content-body-69672109" itemprop="articleBody"><p><span class="drop-caps">F</span>or the last four decades, political narratives in Andhra Pradesh have always hinged on caste equations. Even if we look at the composition of the current National Democratic Alliance (NDA), the two major parties — the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and the Jana Sena Party (JSP) — are largely represented by two major castes in Andhra Pradesh — the Kammas and the Kapus. Similarly, the Congress and YSR Congress Party are dominated by the Reddy community.</p><p>This was not always the case. Before the 1980s, the key players in Andhra Pradesh were the Congress and Left parties, and their narratives were largely based on social issues. Though there were underlying currents of caste-based politics, these did not surface often. The narrative of caste-based politics started with the entry of N.T. Rama Rao into politics in 1982. Rao, the founder of the TDP, advocated for Telugu pride, yet his party was often termed a ‘Kamma party’.</p><p>Ever since the composite State of Andhra Pradesh was bifurcated in 2014, and Telangana was formed, the politics in the residual State of Andhra Pradesh has changed and has assumed religious overtones. While this was noticeable during the previous YSRCP government headed by Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, it has become all the more evident during the current NDA regime, which came to power in 2024. Political narratives have been based largely on a number of issues revolving around places of worship and have caused quite a stir in the State.</p><p>The most prominent of these is the controversy surrounding the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam (TTD). It broke out in September 2024 when Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu alleged that the laddu prasadam was being made with adulterated ghee containing animal fat. He claimed that the contract for the supply of sub-standard ghee had been given to a firm by the earlier YSRCP government.</p><p>The accusation caused political and religious outrage across the country. Deputy Chief Minister Pawan Kalyan, who is the JSP chief, claimed that adding adulterated ghee was a concerted move to attack Sanatana Dharma. The parties and allies of the NDA left no stone unturned in attacking Mr. Jagan Reddy and his party. They went to the extent of saying that the practice of hiring staff from other faiths had led to ‘sacrilege’ of the TTD. A Special Investigation Team was constituted to probe this matter and the issue finally reached the Supreme Court.</p><p>When the controversy died down after a couple of months, Mr. Reddy turned the tables on the NDA following a stampede at the Vaikunta Ekadasi festival at the TTD temple in Tirupati. The incident, which took place on January 8, claimed six lives. Mr. Jagan Reddy and his party alleged negligence, and held the NDA responsible for it.</p><p>Before this incident too could die down, TTD’s former chairman, former MLA Bhumana</p><p>Karunakar Reddy, alleged that over 170 cows had died in a month at the devasthanams goshala (cow shed) and said that funds for the goshala were being misused by the present TTD board and officials. This led to tense moments in the temple town. Both the YSRCP and the NDA locked horns over the issue. All the political parties in the State, including the Left parties, took turns to add to the discourse. The issue reached a feverish pitch and dominated the political narrative in the State.</p><p>However, this is not the case only with the present NDA regime although it seems more prominent now. The desecration of Lord Rama’s idol at the 12th century Ramatheertham yemple in Vizianagaram district in December 2020 gained considerable political traction. The YSRCP was in power then. All the Opposition parties, including the TDP, the JSP, and the BJP, raised their pitch and made this an election issue in the 2024 general elections. In the same year, a century-old wooden chariot of the Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy temple, located in Sakhinetipalli Mandal in East Godavari district, was set on fire by miscreants. The Opposition parties alleged that people from other faiths had set fire to the chariot. The suspect in the case, who hails from a minority community, was killed in a road accident.</p><p>Senior politicians and political analysts say that this appears to be a new trend in the State. With religious issues taking centre stage, core issues are taking a backseat.</p><p><b><i>sumit.b@thehindu.co.in</i></b></p><div id="arthardpv"></div><div></div><div><div id="artproduct2"></div></div><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/Hindu_Desktop_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/Hindu_Desktop_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid05, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid05, publisher: The Hindu --></div><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Mweb_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Mweb_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle05, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle05, publisher: The Hindu --></div></div></div><div class="col-xl-9 col-lg-8 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-12 editorial" data-id="69672120" data-title="​Lawful measures: On Manipur and law and order " data-url="https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/lawful-measures-on-manipur-and-law-and-order/article69672120.ece"><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --></div><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --></div><h1 class="title" itemprop="name">
​Lawful measures: On Manipur and law and order 
</h1><h2 class="sub-title">Breaking the cycle of impunity in Manipur requires unpopular measures</h2><div id="content-body-69672120" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Ethnic conflicts, unlike other variants of strife, are more difficult to end because of the nature and the level of grievances of the communities hostile to each other. This persecution complex is fed by those who drive passions to such an extent that taking a position on reconciliation through mutual compromises and peace-building becomes difficult even if a silent majority are in favour of it. Using threats by brandishing arms, chauvinist sections try to drown out voices of reason by drilling in fear and ideas of further vengeance. That seems to be the case with Manipur too, where, after months of dilly-dallying over taking on the patrons of violence, the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Union government has finally decided to isolate such elements and subject them to the long arm of the law. That the Imphal valley has again erupted in protest over the arrest of leaders of the extremist identitarian outfit, Arambai Tenggol, highlights the necessity and the difficulty of implementing law enforcement measures in an ethnic conflict. This group had engaged in acts of wanton lawlessness with impunity, targeting those who did not agree with its militant agenda with violence and threats. It had also coerced MLAs into signing pledges for its chauvinist cause. Shockingly, the then BJP-led State government looked the other way – a consequence of Chief Minister N. Biren Singh’s inability to rise above his partisanship. The security forces were also unable to act because of public protection for the violent offenders. Soon, such groups went to become a major threat to peace and it was only after implementing President’s Rule that the government managed to get the group, among others, to return most of the weapons looted from police constabularies</p><p>The arrests have coincided with similar actions against other militant volunteers in the hills who were allegedly involved in violence against law enforcement officers. The government of Manipur, which is currently under President’s Rule, must make a clear case of the involvement of those arrested in crimes and bring them to justice. It should not give in to the threats made by those stoking communal passions, and must convince the people – across ethnic lines – that these are lawful actions against malefactors. It must simultaneously engage in talks with other stakeholders, also asserting that such steps will coincide with peace-building and rehabilitation measures. It must use devices such as convening all-party meetings and involving civil society representatives from across all ethnic lines to reinforce this message, and must not give in to pressure to reverse the legal steps taken against the offenders.</p><div data-fragment-url="https://www.thehindu.com/fragment/getregionallist/69672120" id="reginallist"></div><div id="arthardpv"></div><div></div><div><div id="artproduct2"></div></div><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/Hindu_Desktop_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/Hindu_Desktop_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid05, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid05, publisher: The Hindu --></div><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Mweb_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Mweb_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle05, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle05, publisher: The Hindu --></div></div></div><div class="col-xl-9 col-lg-8 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-12 opinion" data-id="69672025" data-title="Consultative regulation-making that should go further" data-url="https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/consultative-regulation-making-that-should-go-further/article69672025.ece"><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --></div><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_Interstitial, publisher: The Hindu --></div><h1 class="title" itemprop="name">

                                      </p></div><div id="content-body-69672025" itemprop="articleBody"><p>In May this year, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issued a policy framework for how it will publish regulations, directions, guidelines and notifications. This follows a similar move by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), in February, which published regulations setting out the procedure it would follow to issue regulations.</p><p>Regulators such as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and SEBI, have been created by Acts of Parliament and have quasi-legislative powers. Within this context, strong procedural safeguards and robust checks and balances are essential to uphold the rule of law. The recent frameworks, which outline the procedures that the RBI and SEBI must follow when making law, are a welcome start. When proposing any new regulations or amendment to existing regulations, the RBI will now conduct “impact analyses” and SEBI will state the “regulatory intent and objectives”. Both regulators will also invite public comments for 21 days. Moreover, they will now periodically review their own regulations.</p><p>These reforms signal a welcome shift toward more transparent and consultative regulation-making. Yet, they can, and should go further. Two additions will make these processes more robust, and ensure greater transparency and accountability. First, regulators should clearly identify the economic rationale for their interventions, and second, they should institute mechanisms to ensure accountability for periodic reviews and responses to public comments.</p><h4 class="sub_head">The issue of market failure</h4><p>The RBI’s impact analyses and SEBI’s statements of objectives must be grounded in economic rationale that identifies the problem that their proposed regulation will address. In 2013, the Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission (FSLRC) emphasised that “laws must be defined in terms of their economic purpose”. Regulatory practices in other jurisdictions also support the FSLRC’s suggestion.</p><p>For example, executive memoranda in the United States mandate that regulators undertake a cost-benefit analysis before proposing or adopting a regulation. Regulators there must also ensure the “least burden on society”, adopt an approach that maximises benefits, and assess the feasibility of alternatives to direct regulation. As another example, under the European Union’s Better Regulation Framework, impact assessments involve identifying the problem, potential solutions and their impact, and mechanism for monitoring and evaluating the results.</p><p>Currently, RBI’s framework calls for “impact analysis” considering “economic environments”. SEBI must explain its objectives. However, neither are explicitly required to provide the economic rationale of any proposed regulation or identify the underlying market failure. This can be contrasted with the framework implemented by the International Financial Services Centres Authority (IFSCA), which must state the issue that its proposed regulation seeks to address.</p><p>Financial sector regulators such as the RBI and SEBI should: identify the market failure that necessitates regulatory intervention; demonstrate how the proposed regulation will address such failure; conduct a cost-benefit analysis to demonstrate the expected impact of the proposed regulation, and formulate a monitoring and evaluation framework to assess the impact of the regulation.</p><h4 class="sub_head">Strengthening accountability</h4><p>The track records of the regulators in consultative regulation-making are not encouraging. It was found by two researchers that between June 2014 and July 2015, the RBI had sought public comments on 2.4% of its circulars while SEBI had done the same on less than half of its regulations. Even though this suggests that there are limited opportunities for stakeholders to submit their views on proposed regulation, one is optimistic that this will now change. However, the regulators must be transparent in their approaches toward consultative regulation-making. The reporting of the following information on an annual basis will strengthen accountability: the number of public consultations vis-à-vis the number of proposed regulations or amendments; responses received; suggestions that have been accepted and rejected; rationale for acceptance and rejection; the impact of public feedback on the proposed regulation or amendment, and, finally, all associated timelines. This is by no means an exhaustive list. Some of this information can be found in the agendas for SEBI’s board meetings. But typically, as in SEBI’s latest board meeting, the summary of public comments is “excised for reasons of confidentiality”.</p><p>In addition, the RBI and SEBI must define the intervals at which they will review their regulations. This is relevant in the context of promises toward deregulation. Once again, this is may be contrasted with the IFSCA’s framework, which mandates a review every three years. Regulators should, at pre-defined and reasonably frequent intervals, assess whether current regulations are achieving their intended objectives and addressing the problems they were designed to solve.</p><h4 class="sub_head">A hurdle</h4><p>Good regulatory practice warrants meaningful justification for regulatory intervention, and the RBI and SEBI have taken the initial steps in that direction. Notably, limited state capacity is a significant hurdle to implementing regulatory impact assessments and consultative practices.</p><p>Moreover, piecemeal reforms by individual regulators may not be sufficient to ensure consistent adherence to good regulatory practice. Parliament could contemplate enactment of a law, similar to the Administrative Procedure Act in the United States, with standardised procedures for regulation-making, which includes impact analysis, public consultation and periodic review.</p><p>The United Kingdom and Canada have issued guidelines for regulation-making by agencies. Such an approach would institutionalise transparency and accountability for all regulators in India.</p><p><b><i>Natasha Aggarwal is a Senior Research Fellow at TrustBridge Rule of Law Foundation.

Hardy wrote in his classic <i>A Mathematician’s Apology</i>, “ A mathematician, like a painter or a poet, is a maker of patterns. If his patterns are more permanent than theirs, it is because they are made with ideas.” Du Sautoy credits Hardy with stirring his interest in maths in his recent book, <i>Blue Prints: How Mathematics Shapes Creativity. </i></p><p>He paints a large canvas, with scientists, architects, musicians, artists, choreographers, writers all of whom use mathematics – consciously or otherwise – in their work. Blueprints are the fundamental mathematical structures that underpin human creativity, he says, and goes on to discuss nine such blueprints from primes to randomness. Leonardo da Vinci, Jackson Pollock, Borges, Escher, Bowie are only a few of the non-mathematicians who appear as we discover patterns in unexpected places. Hardy wrote, “the mathematician’s patterns must be beautiful…beauty is the first test, there is no permanent place in this world for ugly mathematics.” You can see that here. </p><p>Du Sautoy tells us that <i>Macbeth</i> has a numerical structure based on prime numbers and that the number of words in key scenes is a prime number. This rhythm contributes to the unsettling atmosphere of the play. Mozart’s <i>The Magic Flute</i>, says du Sautoy, is  ‘dripping with maths’. The abstract works of Jackson Pollock which gave the impression of paint thrown recklessly onto a canvas had a deliberate structure too. Pollock always insisted he there was no accident in his work. He painted fractals, geometric patterns that repeat arbitrarily. Interestingly, when some canvases supposedly by Pollock were discovered after his death, they were shown to be fakes because they were not fractals. </p><p>As students, we are told of the separation between the arts and the sciences; we often carry that idea into adult life. Mathematics, says Marcus du Sautoy, is the bridge that connects this cultural divide. </p><div id="arthardpv"></div><div></div><div><div id="artproduct2"></div></div><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/Hindu_Desktop_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/Hindu_Desktop_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid05, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Desktop_AT_Mid05, publisher: The Hindu --></div><div><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle01, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_Mweb_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_Mweb_Inarticle_1x1, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle02, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle03, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle04, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- Begin DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle05, publisher: The Hindu --><!-- End DFP : /22390678/TH_MWeb_AT_Middle05, publisher: The Hindu --></div></div></div>
